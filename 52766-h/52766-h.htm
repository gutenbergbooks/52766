<div><span class='pageno' title='v' id='Page_v'></span><h1>PREFACE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> lamented death of President Adams entails on me the
duty of writing the preface to our joint work,—a duty which,
had he lived, would naturally have fallen to him, since to his
initiative and energy the volume owes its existence. Fortunately,
the entire manuscript had the benefit of his wisdom
and experience as teacher and investigator, and the proofs
of about half the book passed under his watchful supervision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five years ago, in a letter to me proposing the book, Dr.
Adams gave, among his reasons for wishing to add to the
long list of school histories of the United States, three
principal objects:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, to present fully and with fairness the Southern point
of view in the great controversies that long threatened to
divide the Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second, to treat the Revolutionary War, and the causes that
led to it, impartially and with more regard for British contentions
than has been usual among American writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, to emphasize the importance of the West in the
growth and development of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These objects have been kept constantly in view. We felt,
moreover, that the development of institutions and government
may justly be considered of great importance, although
naturally lacking in picturesqueness, and we have endeavored
to set in relief this evolutionary process. How far we have
succeeded in accomplishing the objects sought remains for
others to judge.
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot forbear to place on record here my appreciation
of the fortitude with which Dr. Adams bore his protracted
sufferings and did his work; of his conscientiousness in matters
of minutest detail; of his fairness and sympathy toward
those with whom he did not agree, and of the unfailing courtesy
that marked every line of his correspondence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acknowledgment is due to the highly competent services
of Miss May Langdon White of New York, whom Dr. Adams
selected to assist in the revision of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s1'></a><span class='bold'>1. The Aborigines.</span>—When America became known to Europe
at the end of the fifteenth century, it was by no means an uninhabited
country. Wherever the discoverers effected a landing,
and however far they pushed inland, they found themselves confronted
by native inhabitants of varying degrees of savagery.
Hence the settlement of both Americas, from first to last, has
been dependent upon the supplanting of one race by another
or upon their intermixture.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s2'></a><span class='bold'>2. Characteristics of the Indians.</span>—The original inhabitants
of both continents have been known as Indians, in consequence
of a mistake made by Columbus (§§ <a href='#s5'>5</a>-<a href='#s7'>7</a>). The North American
Indians were fiercer foes than the native Mexicans and Peruvians
whom the Spaniards, under Cortez and Pizarro, overcame, and
with whom they intermarried. We know, however, from linguistic
characteristics, that all the aborigines from the Arctic Circle
to Cape Horn belonged to the same race. How they first came
to America is a matter of dispute; but their main peculiarities
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
are well understood. In Peru and Mexico they had made some
progress toward civilization. They constructed good roads,
were not unskillful artisans, and had
even learned some astronomy. But
they lived in large communal groups
under their chiefs, and had made slight
advance in the art of government;
hence they fell an easy prey to small
bodies of Spaniards. Similar in character
to the Mexicans, but inferior to
them, were the Pueblos and Cliff-dwellers
of the region of New Mexico,
Arizona, and Lower California,
as well as the Natchez Indians of the
Lower Mississippi Valley. Most of
the North American Indian tribes
lived in villages of wigwams and had a primitive form of
government. In each village there was a communal, or
“long,” house, in which clan business was transacted. In a
few cases this “long” house gave shelter to a whole tribe.
These Indians, except among the Southern tribes mentioned
below, were chiefly in what is called the hunter and fisher
state, although they frequently practiced a rude form of agriculture.
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
Sometimes, however, as in the case of the Digger
Indians, they subsisted mainly on roots.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s3'></a><span class='bold'>3. The Principal Indian Tribes.</span>—Of
the North American Indians
with whom our own forefathers
came chiefly in contact, there were
four principal groups, commonly
known as the Algonquins, the Iroquois,
the Southern Indians, and
the Dakotahs. The Algonquins
were the most numerous, although
it is doubtful if at any time they
numbered ninety thousand. Ranging
through the vast forests from
Kentucky to Hudson Bay and from
the Mississippi to the Atlantic,
they were naturally in frequent
conflict with the whites. Opposed to these, and wedged
into the very center of their territory, were the fierce
Iroquois, the craftiest of
their race, whose tribal
names—Mohawks, Oneidas,
Onondagas, Cayugas,
and Senecas—are inseparably
connected with
rivers and lakes in the
State of New York. They
formed a loose confederacy,
called by the whites the “Five Nations.”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> The Southern
Indians showed a milder disposition and were given to agriculture
and rude manufactures. Of these the Creeks were the
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
most advanced; beneath them in point of civilization were the
Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Seminoles.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> West of
the Mississippi ranged the
wandering Dakotahs or Sioux,
fierce fighters, whose descendants
have given trouble down
to our own day. Of the inferior
tribes living in the extreme
north of the continent, we need
take no special account.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s4'></a><span class='bold'>4. The Northmen.</span>—While
Columbus and his followers
were the real discoverers of
America in the sense that they
first made it generally known
to Europe, it is practically certain
that they were not the
first Europeans to set foot on
the new continent. It is possible
that seamen from France
and England preceded Columbus,
but there is much better
reason to believe that Scandinavians
from Iceland, having
first discovered Greenland,
visited the North American
mainland as early as the year
1000. Evidence to this effect is found in the so-called
Sagas of the Northmen, poetic chronicles based on tradition
and dating from about two centuries after the events which
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
they recorded. According to these stories, navigators were
driven south from Greenland to a strange shore about the year
985. Fourteen years later, Leif, son of Eric the Red, having
introduced Christianity from Norway into Iceland and
Greenland, visited the newly discovered land, with thirty-five
companions. They wintered in a country which, from its
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
abundance of wild grape vines, they called Vinland, built
some houses, and then returned to Greenland with a cargo of
timber. Several other
voyages were made
thither and a temporary
colony was established,
the latest mention of
a voyage dating from
about the middle of
the fourteenth century.
Such is the story
of the Sagas. The main
features of the account
are generally held to
be correct, but the location
of the Northmen’s
Vinland cannot be determined,
and no archæological
remains have
been found on the
American continent to corroborate the Sagas.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

of Genoa is entitled to the honor of being considered the real
discoverer of America
is clearly proved by
the fact that he was
the first person who
planned to sail westward
over the unknown
ocean, and that
he never faltered in
the prosecution of his
heroic design. It is
true that he made the
mistake of thinking he
would come to India
rather than to a new
continent, and that
he underestimated the
distance he would
have to sail; but
such mistakes were
natural in view of the
lack of geographical knowledge at that time. It was generally
believed, by priest and layman alike, that the earth was flat,
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
and good Scripture warrant was produced for the belief. Yet
since the days of Aristotle a few scholars had concluded, from
the evidences furnished by eclipses and from other reasons,
that the earth was spherical in form. Columbus had obtained
this idea from some source and seems to have been fascinated by
the possibilities it opened. Oriental commerce, especially that
from India, was then of great consequence to Italian merchants;
and if the recent military successes of the Turks should close
the overland routes to the East, it was thought this commerce
would be destroyed. But Columbus held that, if the earth
were round, India could be reached by sailing westward, and
thus trade could be carried on in spite of the Turks.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s6'></a><span class='bold'>6. Motives and Difficulties of Columbus.</span>—Columbus was
urged on by patriotism, desire of gain, missionary hopes of
Christianizing distant lands, and a natural enthusiasm for
heroic enterprise. He corresponded with Toscanelli, a learned
Italian, who sent him letters and a map, but underestimated
greatly the distance to be traversed. This mistake was fortunate,
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
as Columbus would probably never have secured a hearing
had he proposed to take a voyage of ten thousand miles,—the
actual distance between Spain and the East Indies. As
it was, for a long time he applied in vain to princes and
potentates—who alone could sustain the expenses of such an
expedition—for permission and means to make a voyage which
he believed to be about three thousand miles in length. The
record of his hopes and fears, his successes and reverses, reads
like a heroic poem. Fortunately for him, the Portuguese had
been making voyages down the African coast, with their eyes
fixed on the Eastern trade, and the Spaniards, strong through
the recent union of Castile and Aragon and the conquest of the
Moorish kingdom of Granada, had been aroused to eager rivalry
in maritime enterprise. At the court of Ferdinand and Isabella,
the Spanish monarchs, Columbus eloquently pleaded his cause.
Success at last crowned his efforts. Under the patronage of
Isabella he sailed from the port of Palos, with a fleet of three
vessels, on the 3d of August, 1492.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s7'></a><span class='bold'>7. Voyages of Columbus.</span>—Within a month the adventurers
had left the Canaries and were traversing the unknown ocean.
As the days went by the crews became restless, but the
dauntless resolution of Columbus prevented mutiny. Finally,
after a fortunate change of course to the southwest, the great
navigator saw a light ahead, on the evening of October 11, and
the following morning he found that an island had been reached.
It was probably Watling’s Island, one of the Bahama group,
though the identity of the landing place has been a matter of
much dispute.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> On this first voyage Columbus coasted along
the northern side of Cuba, and also discovered the island now
known as Hayti. Then, after losing his largest ship and suffering
many other trials, he returned to Spain, confident that he
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
had reached islands off the coast of India. The Spanish sovereigns
received him with great respect and pomp, and soon sent
him back to take possession of his discoveries in the name of
Spain. Unfortunately, there was little or no wealth to be obtained
from the new possessions except by capable colonists,
and Columbus was not fitted to govern dependencies. So
great did the opposition to him become that he was arrested
some years later, on account of charges of extortion and cruelty
brought by his followers, and was sent to Spain in irons. He
was soon released, however, and undertook his fourth and last
voyage. The results of his last three expeditions were not
important. He succeeded in exploring more of Cuba, and in
discovering Jamaica. He reached also the mouth of the Orinoco,
and was much puzzled to account for its size, which was
too great for an island river. On his last voyage he coasted
the shores of Central America, in a vain search for a waterway
to India. He found no strait, but did find an isthmus; and
when he heard reports of a vast body of water lying on the
other side of the land, he thought that it must be the Indian
Ocean. Thus he was confirmed in his error with regard to the
nearness of India, and doubtless cherished his delusion to his
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
death. After his fourth voyage he returned to Spain, and died
there in 1506, in poverty and obscurity.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s8'></a><span class='bold'>8. The Cabots and the English Title.</span>—Almost immediately
after Columbus’s first voyage, Pope Alexander VI. issued a
bull dividing the non-Christian portion of the world into two
parts: Spain to have all that she might discover west of a line
to be drawn one hundred leagues west of the Azores; and Portugal
all that she might discover east of it. In the following
year the rival nations fixed the line at three hundred and
seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Aroused by
these events, Henry VII. of England, who was laying the
foundations of Tudor greatness, granted a license of exploration
to John Cabot, an Italian then living in Bristol. This
seaman landed somewhere near the mouth of the St. Lawrence
River, in 1497. Accounts of the voyage are unsatisfactory;
and those of the voyage of 1498, supposed to have been made
under the command of Cabot’s son Sebastian,<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> are still more
vague. That the Cabots did make northerly discoveries on
which the English based their right to colonize North America
is, however, quite certain.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s9'></a><span class='bold'>9. Other Successors of Columbus.</span>—The discovery of the
West Indies, as the new islands were named in consequence
of Columbus’s mistake, naturally gave a great impetus to exploration.
In 1497–98 the Portuguese under Vasco da Gama
rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached the real India,
the goal of their desires. In the last year of the same century
another Portuguese, Gaspar Cortereal, explored a good deal of
the North American coast, and in a few years Newfoundland
was much frequented by fishermen, especially from France
and England.<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> Little was known, however, about the geography
of the new world. Many strange errors were current
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
respecting it, and some years passed before it was given a name.
One of the errors was that North America was a projection of
Asia, which was not disproved until 1728, when the Russian
navigator Vitus Bering sailed from the Pacific into the Arctic
Ocean. This error had much to do with the delay in furnishing
the two continents with names. By a curious chain of circumstances,
too, the name finally settled upon did not do honor to
Columbus.</p>

the northern coast of South
America, and that in 1504
he wrote an account of his
adventures. This account
circulated as far as the college
town of St. Dié in the
Vosges Mountains, and
was there printed with an
introduction by one of the
professors, Martin Waldseemüller

he made his way to the top of the Cordilleras, and thence

sought. His attempt nine years later to establish a colony
there was a complete failure. Success attended, however, the
expedition of Hernando Cortez for the conquest of Mexico
(1519–1521), and similar good fortune befell that of Francisco
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
Pizarro for the subversion of Peru (1532). The New World
was rapidly alluring the Spaniards, who made many explorations.
For example, Cabeza de Vaca, an officer in Panfilo de
Narvaez’s unfortunate expedition to the Gulf coast, wandered
in the interior regions a long while, and finally emerged on the
Mexican border, with
marvelous tales of what
he had seen and heard
(1536). These tales
caused the Viceroy of
Mexico, Mendoza, to
send a certain friar to
investigate them; and,
upon the facts and the
numerous errors contained
in the friar’s
report, hopes were
founded that induced
the sending out of a
large force under Francisco
Vasquez Coronado
(1540–1542). This
expedition conquered
many pueblo villages
of the Southwest, but
obtained no gold or
silver, and, after struggling as far north as Kansas, ended
in a disconsolate retreat. At about the same time another
expedition was moving westward from Florida through the
Gulf region, under the command of Hernando de Soto (1539–1542).
This gallant man pushed northwest across the mountains
and discovered the Tennessee River, and later the Mississippi;
but he died soon after, and his followers abandoned
their enterprise. Thus by the middle of the century no permanent
Spanish settlement had been made in what is now the
United States. Nor was Spain long to have things her own way.</p>

great leader of the Huguenots, determined to found a place
of refuge for his co-religionists in a more tempting part of
America than Canada. Accordingly, in 1562, Jean Ribaut,
under his orders, sailed for the Southern coast and discovered
the present St. John’s River in Florida. He left a small colony
on Port Royal Sound, but it was soon scattered. Two years
later, René de Laudonnière
established another
settlement on the St.
John’s, but the colonists
were disorderly. Some
of them mutinied and attempted
to plunder the
Spaniards in the West
Indies. Learning thus of
the existence of the French
settlement, the Spaniards
under Menendez organized
a strong expedition against
it. The French had meanwhile
been reënforced by a
fleet under Ribaut and by
Sir John Hawkins, the
English slave-trader and
famous fighter. But in spite of these reënforcements the
French did not use their opportunities, and their vessels were
soon scattered by a storm. Then Menendez, who had just
established himself at St. Augustine (1565), destroyed the
French fort and killed or captured nearly all the Frenchmen at
that time in Florida. St. Augustine, the oldest town in the
United States, still stands to record this savage warfare. A
little later a French soldier, Dominic de Gourges, partly
avenged his countrymen; but St. Augustine was not taken,
and the French crown relinquished all claims to Florida.

the coast of North Carolina, and returned bringing favorable
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
accounts of the region, which was named Virginia, after
the Virgin Queen. The next year Raleigh fitted out seven
ships, and a colony was established on Roanoke Island. This
in spite of several reënforcements finally proved a failure, the
last colonists having disappeared in a manner never accounted
for.<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a> Meanwhile the defeat of the Spanish Armada off the
coast of England had rendered it quite certain that with
England’s sea power established, she would be able to colonize
the northern parts of America without great fear of
molestation.</p>

<h3 id='s19a'>SUMMARY OF RESULTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s19'></a><span class='bold'>19. Colonization in the Sixteenth Century.</span>—As we have just
seen, Spain, France, and England made many efforts during
the sixteenth century to obtain permanent possessions in the
New World. Spain succeeded in Mexico and Peru, and made
a mere beginning in Florida. France did not really get a foothold
in Canada until the first decade of the next century, and
this was likewise the case with the English in Virginia. All
three nations had too many things to disturb them at home to
be able to put forth their full strength in establishing their
claims to the new country. The work of exploration in consequence
was hazardous and slow. Then, again, the precise
value of the possessions they were striving for was
not understood. Men chiefly sought the precious metals, and
in the race for these Spain came off victor. But to obtain
them she sacrificed the lives of the helpless natives and of
imported negro slaves, and thus never laid the foundations for
successful, thriving colonies. She injured herself, too, by
accustoming her own people to the idea that the mother
country ought to be supported by her colonies, and that labor
was beneath a Spaniard of good blood.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s20'></a><span class='bold'>20. Changes in the Theory of Colonization.</span>—France and
England, also, sought for gold and silver, but found none.
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
The lands they occupied could be made productive, but not by
the ne’er-do-well adventurers who first came out. When,
however, fish and furs, and, later on, tobacco, became far
more profitable than the metals would have been, the character
of both English and French colonists gradually improved.
The value of the new possessions was not to be perceived fully,
however, until the eighteenth century, when they played a
part in all the important European wars. Nor even then did
statesmen at home realize that the mother country’s interests
were best served by keeping her colonists prosperous. A
colony was at first viewed merely as a source of revenue, and
in some cases even as a dumping-ground for criminals. It is
only of late that colonies have figured as outlets for superfluous
population and as bases for extending commercial operations.</p>

<h3 id='s21a'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>THE SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s21'></a><span class='bold'>21. The Virginia Company.</span>—At the beginning of the seventeenth
century England undertook in earnest to plant colonies
in North America. Her only important rival was France.
Efforts were first directed toward the vast unoccupied stretch
of country between Canada and Florida. The upper part of
this region was explored, with favorable results, by Bartholomew
Gosnold in 1602, by Martin Pring in 1603, and by George
Weymouth in 1605. These enterprises were encouraged by
the new king, James I., and Raleigh was soon out of favor.
The work of colonization required coöperation; and the example
of the Muscovite and East India companies led certain
important citizens to obtain a charter authorizing them, as
the Virginia Company, to promote and govern colonies in the
unsettled region. It was a favorable time for such an undertaking,
since changes in agricultural methods and other economic
causes had created a spirit of unrest and filled England
with men eager for employment. Besides, the passion for discovery
and the energy that marked Elizabeth’s reign had by
no means died out, and fortune seemed beckoning from the new
shores.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s22'></a><span class='bold'>22. The Sub-companies.</span>—The Virginia Company’s charter
covered a region extending from the thirty-fourth to the forty-fifth
degree of north latitude. This was not to be controlled
by one set of men, however, for there were two sub-companies,
one consisting of the charter members living in or near London,
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
and the other of those living in or near Plymouth. The
Londoners could colonize from the thirty-fourth to the thirty-eighth
degree; the Plymouth people from the forty-first to the
forty-fifth, while the intervening space was left to whichever
company should first colonize it, with the proviso that neither
company should settle within one hundred miles of the other.
This idea of competition between the
companies led to nothing, and indeed
the whole scheme of the charter was a
cumbrous one that promised little permanent
success.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s23'></a><span class='bold'>23. The Settlement at Jamestown.</span>—In
1607 both sub-companies began
operations. The Plymouth men sent a
fleet to the coast of the present state of
Maine, but the colony they tried to plant
was a failure. The London Company
was more fortunate. Their colonists
reached Chesapeake Bay in the spring,
and settled about fifty miles above the mouth of a large river,
since then known as the James, in honor of the English king.
They called their new settlement Jamestown, and at once began
to build huts and fortifications.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s24'></a><span class='bold'>24. Captain John Smith.</span><a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a>—Their leading spirit was Captain
John Smith, an adventurous and able man, who in spite of
jealousies put himself at the head of affairs and saved the
colony. The men sent out were mainly gentlemen adventurers
seeking to mend their fortunes, and even some of the
real workers followed callings not required in the wilderness.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
There was consequently much bickering, and soon a scarcity
of provisions caused great suffering. The site of the town
proved unhealthy, and
the Indians encountered
had to be
watched. Altogether
the situation was a
wretched one, and but
for the energy of
Smith and a few
others, Christopher
Newport, the captain
of the fleet, who had
gone back to England
for supplies,
might have found few
vestiges of a settlement
on his return
in 1609. Newport
brought stores, but
also a number of undesirable
colonists.
He speedily sailed
back to England with a cargo of shining earth, which did not
yield the gold it promised to credulous eyes. Smith besought
the Company to send out good workmen to cultivate the rich
soil; and after a while the promoters of the colony learned
not to expect vast discoveries of gold and silver. In October,
1609, owing to an accident to his eyes, Smith left the colony,
never to return.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s25'></a><span class='bold'>25. Smith’s Character.</span>—Smith’s relations with Virginia have
been the subject of much hostile criticism. Discrepancies have
been found between his earlier and his later accounts of his
exploits, and some historians have been led to regard him as
little more than a braggart. This is an untenable view. His
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
management of the refractory colonists, his dealings with the
Indian chief Powhatan, his wise and manly remonstrances
with the London Company,—all
go to show that he
was an able and unselfish
leader to whom the life of
the struggling settlement
was mainly due. On the
other hand, there can be
little doubt, save in the
minds of his partisans, that
he frequently embellished
his accounts of his adventures,
and that he is not the
most reliable of historians.
It is not at all impossible
that he was really saved by
Pocahontas,<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> yet the story
may be as mythical as the
coat of arms granted to him
by the king of Hungary.</p>

the year of Smith’s departure, King James gave the Virginia
Company a new charter, which defined the limits of its territory
in a very vague way and increased its power over its colonists.
In 1612 he gave another charter, which took in the Bermuda

general meetings in London. Twelve years later, when the
king’s Puritan opponents had got control of these meetings and
used them for political purposes, he caused the charter to be
annulled by a decree of court, which was a legal though not a
justifiable act. The records of the Company were preserved
in a romantic way,<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a> and are now in the possession of the government

<p class='pindent'><a id='s27'></a><span class='bold'>27. Growth of Virginia.</span>—Meanwhile the colony had had various
ups and downs under several governors,—Lord Delaware,
Sir Thomas Dale, the tyrannical Samuel Argall, Sir George
Yeardley, and Sir Francis Wyatt,—but had on the whole become
firmly established. Dale was strict, but successful in
controlling the rougher elements; he also encouraged the policy
of allowing settlers to become individual proprietors of land.
Argall was speedily recalled for his misconduct. Liberal sentiments
then prevailed in the colony, and its inhabitants were
allowed, during Yeardley’s administration, to hold a yearly
representative assembly, or legislature (1619), the first of its
kind in America. This long step toward self-government,
together with the increasing importance of the tobacco crop,
gave Virginia a decided impetus, which the contemporaneous
introduction of slavery, in the persons of twenty blacks landed
and sold at Jamestown by a Dutch ship in 1619, did not at first
affect. The presence of white slaves in the persons of indentured
servants—a class recruited from convicts, vagabonds,
and kidnapped children—produced some confusion. But colonists
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
of position and means soon began to exert an influence
opposed to disorder, and through Sir Francis Wyatt the Company
promised to stand by its grant of free institutions.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s28'></a><span class='bold'>28. Charles I. and the Virginia Burgesses.</span>—In 1622 the
colonists endured a loss of three hundred settlers, from an attack
by the Indians whom they had maltreated. The collapse of
the Company (1624) made Virginia a crown colony, dependent
on the king, who was succeeded the next year (1625) by his
son, Charles I. Charles, needing money in order to be able to
govern without his Parliament, tried to get a profit out of a
monopoly of the tobacco trade, but the colonial assembly, or
Burgesses, as they were called, withstood him (1629). The
convening of this assembly to discuss such a matter was an
important precedent in the government of the crown colonies;
but the assembly, although it could resist the king’s demand,
could not prevent a royal governor like Sir John Harvey from
making himself obnoxious.<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s29'></a><span class='bold'>29. Hudson and New Amsterdam.</span>—In the autumn of 1609
Henry Hudson,<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a> an English seaman employed by the Dutch
East India Company, sailed up the river now called by his
name, as far as the site of Albany. He was searching for a
northwest passage to India; he found instead a good opportunity
to trade with the red men, which the Dutch afterward
cultivated. By 1615 houses were built on the site of
Albany and of the present New York. The fur trade of New
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
Netherland, as the
region was named,
was turned over to
a corporation organized
for that purpose,
called the New
Netherland Company.
Politically no
steps were taken at
first against the English
title to the
country. In 1621 the
Dutch West India
Company took up the
rôle of the New Netherland
Company, and
three years later sent
over a number of colonists.
These settled
mainly near Albany;
but there were other
centers of population, all of which did a thriving fur trade
with the Indians.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s30'></a><span class='bold'>30. Organization of the Dutch Colony.</span>—In 1626 Peter Minuit,
director for the Dutch West India Company, purchased the
Island of Manhattan from the Indians for a trifling amount
(about twenty-five dollars), and made the town of New
Amsterdam, afterward New York, the center of government.
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
In 1629 the Company obtained a new charter and proceeded
to develop a semi-feudal system of land tenure among the
colonists. Individuals, styled “Patroons” (patrons), were
allowed to buy tracts of land from the Indians and to settle
colonists upon them. For every colony of fifty persons the
Patroon was granted a large tract for himself; and as he was
given political and judicial power over his colonists, New
Netherland was soon in the hands of a powerful landed aristocracy,
some families of which have retained a certain prestige
down to the present time.</p>

<h3 id='s31a'>THE PILGRIMS AT PLYMOUTH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s31'></a><span class='bold'>31. The Plymouth Colony.</span>—The London Company and the
Dutch West India Company had now established promising
colonies, but the Plymouth Company had done nothing since
their unsuccessful attempt in 1607. Seven years later, Captain
John Smith had made a voyage along the northern coast and
given the region the name of New England. Other voyages
added to geographical knowledge and developed the fisheries,
but the more southerly colonies for some time attracted all
intending settlers, and the reorganized Plymouth Company of
1620 might have fared poorly had not accident favored them.
This accident was nothing less than the landing of the Pilgrim
Fathers at Plymouth Rock instead of somewhere within the
jurisdiction of the London Company, as they at first intended.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s32'></a><span class='bold'>32. The Pilgrims in Holland.</span>—The causes that led the Pilgrims
to the New World were briefly as follows. There were
large numbers of English Protestants who thought that the
Established Church of England had not sufficiently broken
away from the Church of Rome, especially in regard to the
forms of worship. Such dissatisfied Protestants were called
Puritans, and those of their number who refused to commune
with the Church of England were further known as Dissenters.
Those Dissenters who were ruled by elders, according
to the system of Calvin and Knox, were known as Presbyterians.
Such as desired each congregation to be independent
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
were called Separatists, or Brownists, or Independents. The
Pilgrim Fathers were Separatists who, in order to escape persecution,
had fled from the village of Scrooby to Holland.
The emigrants, headed by their pastor, John Robinson, and
their elder, William Brewster, numbered about one hundred.
Settling first at Amsterdam, then at Leyden, they were joined
by other refugees, and lived peacefully by their labors.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s33'></a><span class='bold'>33. Movement of Pilgrims to America.</span>—These Pilgrims
naturally did not wish their children to become Dutchmen;
so their minds turned to America. Securing a grant of land
from the London Company and financial aid from London
capitalists who became partners in the enterprise, they collected
their effects and sailed to their new home in the
<span class='it'>Mayflower</span>.<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a> They sighted Cape Cod on November 9, 1620.
The captain, for some reason, would not sail farther southward;
so after exploring the coast, the emigrants, who had already
formed themselves into a body politic under a very liberal
written agreement, landed at Plymouth (December 21, 1620).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s34'></a><span class='bold'>34. Experiences of the Pilgrims.</span>—Although the winter was
mild, the colonists had much difficulty in obtaining shelter
and food, and great loss of life was the result, Deacon John
Carver, the first governor, being among the victims. William
Bradford, one of the finest characters in our history, succeeded
him as governor. His courage and that of his people,
who believed firmly that they had the support of God, enabled
the colony to pull through the crisis. Huts and a fort were
built, land was cleared, and provisions and fuel laid in for the
next winter. In November, 1621, fifty more of the Leyden
people arrived. These were a burden to the colonists for a
time, since the supply of food was small; and distribution was
made, as at Jamestown, from the common stock. Settlers continued
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
to be sent out by the London partners, but as a rule
they came empty handed.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s35'></a><span class='bold'>35. Success of the Pilgrims.</span>—The colony nevertheless flourished
under a patent it had obtained from the Plymouth Company.
It owed much of its success to Bradford, who was often
elected to the governorship, and to Captain Miles Standish, a
brave soldier, not a Separatist, who
was especially useful in managing
the Indians. Various neighboring
settlements of Englishmen who ridiculed
the strict customs of the Pilgrims
could not be easily dealt with;
but finally the chief offenders,
Thomas Morton and his associates
at Merrymount, who had furnished
the Indians with firearms, were put
down with a stern hand. Meanwhile
the communal system was abandoned
for individual allotments of
land. At about the same time (1627) the colonists purchased
the share of the London capitalists in the enterprise.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s36'></a><span class='bold'>36. Government of the Pilgrims.</span>—They governed themselves
at first by a primary assembly, then by a general court composed
of two delegates from each township, elected by popular
vote, together with the governor and representatives, called
assistants. In 1636 a special code of laws was adopted; but on
the whole the government remained as simple as were the habits
of the God-fearing, thrifty people, who in many ways set an
example of steadiness and perseverance to all the other colonists.
It was, however, a very small settlement, and after various
failures to secure its perpetuation through a royal charter,
it was finally merged, in 1691, with Massachusetts<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a> (§ <a href='#s60'>60</a>).

<p class='pindent'><a id='s37'></a><span class='bold'>37. The Puritans and the Founding of Massachusetts.</span>—In
1623 some merchants of Dorchester, England, sent out a colony
to the coast of Maine, which for some reason was diverted to the
site of the present Gloucester in Massachusetts. Three years
later the colony was
almost abandoned; but
John White, the Puritan
rector of Trinity
Church, Dorchester,
fearing the aggressions
of the Crown in ecclesiastical
matters, advised
the remaining settlers
to continue at Salem,
whither they had migrated,
and immediately
laid plans in
England for planting
a permanent colony.
Two years later a patent
was obtained from
the Plymouth Company
for a strip of
coast land, and John
Endicott<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a> led sixty
persons to Salem. In
1629 the owners of the
patent, who still lived in England, were organized as a Company
and given a charter by the king. This charter provided
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
for popular election of the governor and other officers, for a
“general court,” or assembly, as well as for the passage of
laws not conflicting with those of England.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s38'></a><span class='bold'>38. Government of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay.</span>—The
new “Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England”
was ostensibly to engage in trade, but in reality its founders
intended to form a religious commonwealth. This could be
easily done, since somehow or other no proviso that the Company
should have its headquarters in England was inserted in
the charter. Thus it
was possible to transport
the Company
bodily to New England,
and this a number
of prominent
Puritans, at a meeting
held at Cambridge
in 1629, agreed
to do. There was to
be no violent separation
from the Established
Church except
such as was caused
by distance; but uncongenial
practices
would be avoided,
and the heavy hand
of Archbishop Laud,
then the strenuous
Primate of England,
would hardly reach across the sea. Thus many men of
wealth and education, whose conservatism would naturally
have prevented their taking rash steps in their opposition
to the Crown, were led to join in the Massachusetts enterprise.
In April, 1630, eleven vessels sailed for America,
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
and by the end of the year about a thousand persons had
emigrated to the new colony and founded such towns as
Boston, Charlestown, and Watertown. They chose as governor
a wealthy and highly educated Suffolk gentleman, John
Winthrop,<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[29]</span></sup></a> and under his able administration the colony began
a career of great prosperity and importance.</p>

Born about 1595; died, 1617. Daughter of the Indian chief Powhatan.
Smith reports that when he was taken prisoner by Powhatan and was about
to be put to death, Pocahontas placed her own head in the way of the executioner’s
club. This may have been a sign that she wished to have Smith
spared that he might become her husband. It is at least certain that Smith
was sent back to Jamestown, and that Pocahontas afterward befriended the
colonists. She was converted to Christianity in 1613, and christened Rebecca;
married John Rolfe in 1614; went to England in 1616, and was presented at
the court of James I. as Princess Lady Rebecca. From her have descended

province was named Maryland, after Queen Henrietta Maria.
Lord Baltimore died before he could utilize his grant; but his
son, Cecilius Calvert,
inherited it and became
almost a feudal
sovereign in the new
region. He could
declare war, appoint
all officers, and confer
titles. The freemen
of the colony
were to assist him in
making laws which
required no supervision
in England; and
the colonists were
granted an unprecedented
amount of
religious liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s40'></a><span class='bold'>40. The Growth of
Maryland.</span>—In November,
1633, Leonard
Calvert, brother of Cecilius, crossed the ocean with two
hundred colonists, and the next year the town of St. Mary’s
was founded. Trouble soon arose with a prominent Virginian,
William Claiborne, who had previously established a colony on
Kent Island, within Baltimore’s jurisdiction. Claiborne was
finally expelled, and the colonists, although many of them were
Protestants, settled down peacefully. Disputes, however, soon
arose with Cecilius Calvert over laws which the freemen insisted
on passing; but no serious trouble occurred until the Civil War
broke out in England. Then the Protestants gained the upper
hand, and in 1645 Leonard Calvert was forced to flee to Virginia.
He soon returned, however, and governed until his
death, in 1647. After this, considerable confusion ensued;
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
and when Virginia had been secured for the Parliamentarians
(§ <a href='#s42'>42</a>), Claiborne, who had cherished his grievances, compelled
Governor Stone of Maryland to renounce his allegiance
to Lord Baltimore. When Stone repudiated this agreement,
Claiborne, who was a parliamentary commissioner, with the aid
of an armed force deposed him, and Maryland passed under the
control of the Protestants, who would not allow Roman Catholics
to vote or hold office. Cromwell, however, forbade interference
with the rights of the Second Lord Baltimore, and Stone, the
latter’s legal representative, endeavored to overthrow the Puritan
government of the colony, but was defeated in a battle at
Providence in 1655. Two years later, Baltimore, through the
favor of the English Parliamentarians, recovered his proprietorship
and obtained control of Maryland, after a compromise
had been made with the Puritan colonists and their Virginia
abettors. Greater privileges were granted to the freemen, and
there was a general religious toleration. Then followed the excellent
administration for fourteen years (1661–1675) of Charles
Calvert, the eldest son of Cecilius, who at the end of that period
became the third Lord Baltimore. During his governorship
many Quakers and foreign immigrants were attracted to the
colony, which produced fine crops, notably of tobacco.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s41'></a><span class='bold'>41. Revolts of Fendall and Coode.</span>—In 1681 there was a slight
revolt, led by a demagogue named Josias Fendall, who had
previously been treacherous to the proprietor. He was aided
by John Coode, a retired clergyman, and by some Virginians.
The uprising was easily put down and would not have made
headway had not the people been disturbed by an unpopular
local law about the suffrage and by religious and economic
legislation in England (§ <a href='#s43'>43</a>). Another revolt in 1689, led by
Coode, was more successful. But in two years the revolutionists
were driven from power, and Maryland was made a royal
province, the proprietor becoming merely a landlord.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<h3 id='s42a'>DEVELOPMENT OF VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s42'></a><span class='bold'>42. Virginia under Berkeley’s First Administration.</span>—We
have seen that the royalist governor, Harvey, caused the Virginians
at first to regret the gentle rule of the London Company.
In 1639, however, Sir Francis Wyatt succeeded Harvey,
and affairs began to improve. Three years later, Sir William
Berkeley began his long and checkered career as the king’s
representative. He was a brave, well-educated gentleman, but
full of passions and prejudices that often brought him into
conflict with the colonists. His opposition to all efforts to
make the colonial government more liberal was intense. He
disliked Roman Catholics and hated Puritans; hence such
followers of Baltimore and such New Englanders as happened
to enter Virginia’s borders, were soon made uncomfortable, as
were also the Indians, who were vigorously put down in 1644.
Berkeley and most of the Virginians sympathized with Charles I.
in his struggle against Parliament to such an extent that after
the death of that monarch the governor invited Charles II. to
come to America. Charles was too wise to accept, but several
thousand cavaliers did come, and thus the colony waxed strong.<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a>
Parliament did not fail, however, to assert its supremacy. It
appointed, as its commissioners, William Claiborne, who had
played such a disturbing part in Maryland affairs and was an
enterprising trader, and Richard Bennett, a man of prominence
and excellent character. It also sent a frigate to the Chesapeake;
and with no struggle Berkeley was superseded in 1652
by Bennett, who was elected by the Burgesses. He and his
successors ruled well, on the whole, and the colony prospered.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s43'></a><span class='bold'>43. Virginia under Berkeley’s Second Administration.</span>—With
the Restoration in 1660, Berkeley, who had been living quietly
on his estate, was recalled, and then a period of disturbance
set in. Severe measures against the Puritans alienated them.
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
Enforcement of the Navigation Act, which compelled colonists
to ship tobacco to English ports alone and to receive European
goods only from vessels loaded in England, bore heavily on all
classes. Then again, Charles II.’s grant of the province to two
of his dissolute courtiers, Lords Arlington and Culpepper, naturally
caused indignation. At the same time the bad condition
of the church in the colony, and the corruption of the public
officials, called for correction. The Puritans tried to revolt
in 1663, but were suppressed, and matters grew worse. Berkeley
became despotic and refused to call a new House of Burgesses,
the old House elected in 1660 holding over and actually
passing a law restricting the suffrage under which new elections
would be held. To crown all, the Indians began to murder
frontier settlers; but the governor, who feared printing presses
and schools, feared the native militia also, and would not allow
them to attack the savages.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s44'></a><span class='bold'>44. Bacon’s Rebellion.</span>—At this juncture, Nathaniel Bacon,
a young member of the council, brave, honest, and hot-headed,
raised, without orders, a private force and defeated the Indians
(1676). Berkeley resented this unauthorized action and declared
Bacon and his followers rebels. For several months a
petty civil war went on, good fortune being with Bacon, who
drove Berkeley out of Jamestown, and burned the place. The
revolt would not have reached such dimensions had not the
general situation been intolerable; but it was bound to be
practically local, whatever may have been Bacon’s schemes for
a general colonial uprising against the Crown. Even as a local
movement it was soon ended, for Bacon’s premature death
(October, 1676), whether from poison or fever, left no one to
oppose Berkeley. The latter returned to power and continued
his tyrannical course, executing no less than twenty-three of
the leading rebels. This disgusted Charles II., who had shown
much mildness toward his rebellious subjects in Great Britain.
So Berkeley was recalled to England in 1677, and died there
shortly after in disgrace.
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s45'></a><span class='bold'>45. Berkeley’s Successors.</span>—The Virginians hailed his departure
with bonfires; but in spite of his faults, Berkeley’s career
is a pathetic one. He had not moved with the times. His
successors in office, on the other hand, moved too fast, for they
imitated the corruption of the court at London and overawed
the colonists in addition to taking money from them. There
were six of these governors in twenty-one years. They quarreled
with the Burgesses and kept the colonists in a ferment of
riots and hangings; yet the population grew, and some progress
was made. A new capital was established at Williamsburg,
and the College of William and Mary was founded there in
1692 by Rev. James Blair.</p>

<h3 id='s46a'>DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Sir Henry Vane.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s46'></a><span class='bold'>46. The Progress of Massachusetts.</span>—Although the colony
of Massachusetts Bay had a most vigorous start, it was not
without its troubles from the
beginning. The governor’s
“assistants” soon tried to concentrate
power in their own
hands, but the freemen (who,
by law, must be church members)
resisted, and a representative
house was inaugurated.
Voting by ballot was introduced
in 1634, but it was not
until ten years later that the
administration of affairs was
thoroughly organized under
a governor and two houses.
The migration of such leading
Puritans as Sir Henry Vane
the younger,<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a> and the proposed
coming of others, did not serve
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
to put down the democratic tendencies of the colony, which
was daily increasing in population and wealth, much of the
latter being due to the fisheries and the coasting trade. As a
rule, the colonists were of the educated middle class, thoroughly
religious and devoted to their pastors, many of whom were very
able men. One of these clergymen, John Harvard,<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a> by means
of a legacy and the gift of his library, assured the founding of
the first college in the country, which has since grown into the
great university at Cambridge that bears his name.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s47'></a><span class='bold'>47. Troubles between Massachusetts and the Crown.</span>—Meanwhile
persons who had been driven out for not conforming
with the ideas of church and religion held by the majority of
the citizens of Massachusetts, had complained to Archbishop
Laud, and that prelate and other councilors had passed laws
for securing religious uniformity, obviously aimed at Massachusetts.
The colony was soon up in arms, but dispatched
Edward Winslow to England to try first the force of pleading.
The breaking up of the Plymouth Company complicated
matters, and after legal proceedings the colony’s charter was
declared null and void. The colonists silently refused, however,
to surrender their charter, and were saved from further
external trouble, for a time, by the civil turmoils in England
itself.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s48'></a><span class='bold'>48. Domestic Difficulties.</span>—Internal troubles beset them also,
for they were as determined as their persecutors to have religious
uniformity of their own kind. They drove out the noble pastor
of Salem, Roger Williams, because he was opposed to giving
political power to church members only. They disliked, moreover,
his advocacy of liberal principles of toleration, as well as
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
his theories limiting the king’s power to grant lands in America.
Williams escaped in the winter of 1636, thanks partly to
the kindness of Indians, to whom he was always a friend;
in the spring of the same year he founded Providence Plantation
on Narragansett Bay. Then Massachusetts was thrown
into a ferment by a Mrs. Anne Hutchinson, who preached certain
theological doctrines distasteful to the mass of the Puritans,
although agreeable to some of their leading ministers.
In 1637 she was banished; whereupon some of her adherents
betook themselves to the island of Aquidneck, afterward
called Rhode Island, where she subsequently joined them.
The affair seems ridiculous now, but it disturbed the colony
and marked the beginning of a tyrannical policy of repression
that had evil results (§ <a href='#s55'>55</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s49'></a><span class='bold'>49. Foundation of Rhode Island.</span>—This intolerance led, however,
to the more rapid settlement of New England, and was
thus in part a power for good. The Hutchinsonians founded
a town which they called Portsmouth, and thither, as well as
to Providence, many discontented people flocked from Massachusetts,
both settlements receiving bad names in consequence.
In 1639 Newport was founded by Portsmouth people who dissented
from Mrs. Hutchinson; but the next year the two towns
united to form the colony of Rhode Island. In 1644 all the
towns in the region joined to form the colony of Rhode
Island and Providence Plantations, under a charter obtained by
Roger Williams from the Parliamentarians. A separate charter
was later obtained by a faction for Newport and Portsmouth;
but finally, in 1654, the single colony was restored under Williams.
It was a home of toleration, and as such reflects credit
upon Roger Williams, its founder; but it was for a long time
a home also of fanatics of all sorts.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s50'></a><span class='bold'>50. The Connecticut Settlements.</span>—Meanwhile settlements
had been made by Massachusetts men<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a> on the Connecticut
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
River (1635), which angered the powerful Pequot Indians and
drove them to war. The Narragansetts were kept from the
war-path by the entreaties of Roger Williams, but the Pequots
were strong enough to harass the Connecticut towns of Hartford,
Windsor, Saybrook, and Weathersfield. The Connecticut
settlers appealed for aid to Massachusetts and Plymouth. A
small army was raised which, under Captains John Mason and
John Underhill, stormed the Indian village and almost exterminated
the tribe (1637).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s51'></a><span class='bold'>51. Free Government in Connecticut.</span>—For a short time Connecticut
owed allegiance to Massachusetts, but independence
was assured in 1639. The people adopted a written constitution,
liberal in its terms. This was the first of its kind in
America, and was chiefly the work of Rev. Thomas Hooker of
Hartford. In 1638 a colony was founded at New Haven by a
congregation of Englishmen under Theophilus Eaton and John
Davenport. Other congregations, all ultra-Puritanic, formed
towns around, which were at first independent, but afterward
united with New Haven. The new colony was weak, however,
and was finally joined to Connecticut in 1665.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s52'></a><span class='bold'>52. Evolution of New England.</span>—Four years previously Massachusetts
had absorbed the last of the towns founded in the
colony of Maine, which Sir Ferdinando Gorges, a prominent
member of the Plymouth Company, had been endeavoring to
develop since 1622. The colony of towns planted on the
Piscataqua under the grant made by the Plymouth Company
to John Mason in 1629, which afterward became known as
New Hampshire, was incorporated with Massachusetts by
1643.<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a> Thus one by one the New England colonies were being
evolved and developed, Massachusetts, however, retaining her
primacy. While local differences were soon to be detected,
the people of the entire region were one in their main characteristics.
They were religious after the Puritan fashion.
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
They were brave and enterprising in extending their borders
and their influence. They were thrifty and resolute in extracting
wealth from their rugged soil and their storm-tossed
waters.</p>

<h3 id='s53a'>THE NEW ENGLAND CONFEDERACY.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s53'></a><span class='bold'>53. Formation of the Confederacy.</span>—Similarity of habits,
union of interests, and contiguity of territory naturally led
the New England colonies early to think of establishing some
form of political union. In 1637 the Connecticut people, who
were menaced by the Dutch on the one hand and by the French
Canadians and Indians on the other, made overtures for union
to the people of Massachusetts. The latter were indifferent,
but the proposition was renewed in 1639 and in 1643, and
was acted upon favorably in the latter year. One reason for
the final success of the movement for union was the belief
that the civil turmoil in England might react on this side
of the Atlantic, especially if the illiberal king should win.
Accordingly, in 1643 a written constitution bound the colonies
of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven
in a “perpetual league of friendship and amity for offense and
defense,” under the name of “The United Colonies of New
England.” Each colony was independent in local matters,
and each contributed two members to a commission which
determined such large matters of common interest as declaring
war, forming leagues, etc. In case of disagreement among the
commissioners, questions were to be decided by the legislatures
of the colonies.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s54'></a><span class='bold'>54. The Work of the Confederacy.</span>—The Confederacy thus
established lasted theoretically forty-one years, but was really
efficient only during the first twenty. The chief difficulty it
had to contend with was the disproportionate burden laid
upon Massachusetts, which had but one vote and yet was
more heavily taxed in men and money than any other member
of the league. This led to friction, but in the main, Massachusetts,
being stronger than the other colonies, succeeded in
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
directing the general policy. This was on the whole exclusive,
since the people of Rhode Island and Maine were not allowed
to enter the league. There was a curious disregard of England’s
wishes in the matter of such a combination of dependent colonies,
but at that time England had enough to do in looking after
herself. Massachusetts was particularly jealous of English interference,
and did not even proclaim the Protectorate of so
stanch a Puritan as Cromwell. The Confederacy need not, indeed,
have attracted much notice, for the commissioners acted
mainly as a committee to look after the general prosperity of
the colonies. But Massachusetts showed not a little boldness
in passing laws against the raising of troops in the interest of
King Charles. There was also, as was to be expected, quite a
show of religious independence. The Presbyterians, although
for a short time triumphant in England, were not so fortunate
in Massachusetts; for in 1648 a synod was held at Cambridge,
which defined and established a Congregational system, the
principles of which have been strong in New England ever
since, and have played an important part in the evolution of
American democracy.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s55'></a><span class='bold'>55. Trouble with the Dutch.</span>—Meanwhile the settlers in New
Haven and Connecticut came into unpleasant relations with the
Dutch at New Amsterdam, on account of settlements pushed
out in the direction of the latter. When England and Holland
went to war in 1652, the Connecticut colonies tried to make
the other members of the Confederacy engage in hostilities
with the Dutch in America, but Massachusetts resisted.
Cromwell sent over a fleet to Boston, which only partially
succeeded in coercing Massachusetts; but before the eight
hundred New Englanders gathered to attack New Amsterdam
could be utilized, news came that England and Holland had
made peace. Another instance of local troubles between
Connecticut and Massachusetts was due to a war of trade
duties between the two colonies, which came near breaking
down the union. Still another cause of commotion was the
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
arrival in Massachusetts of a few members of the newly
established society of Friends, or Quakers, who astonished the
staid citizens by their extravagant opposition to the state religion.
Some laws were passed against them, and four were
actually hanged on Boston Common. Plymouth and New
Haven also treated them harshly, but Connecticut indulged in
little persecution, and Rhode Island in none at all.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s56'></a><span class='bold'>56. Dissolution of the New England Confederacy.</span>—The practical
breaking up of the Confederacy followed the restoration of
Charles II., and was due to the fact that the king suspected
that the colonies wished to separate completely from England.
They had been slow to recognize his supremacy, and had harbored
two of the judges that had condemned his father. At
first Massachusetts managed to stave off the crisis; but in 1664
the king sent over four royal commissioners to investigate
colonial affairs. After conquering the Dutch port of New
Amsterdam, with the aid of Connecticut and of the troops they
brought over, the commissioners quarreled with the people of
Massachusetts with regard to their charter. The General Court
of the colony evaded giving an answer to the king’s demands,
and his agents returned home, having accomplished little.
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Plymouth were more submissive,
and the first named was rewarded with a liberal charter
and with the annexation of New Haven. This interference of
the king with American affairs greatly weakened the Confederacy;
besides, the new generation that was growing up probably
did not feel the same alienation from England that their
fathers had felt.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s57'></a><span class='bold'>57. King Philip’s War.</span>—Meanwhile there had been trouble
with the Indians, although the New Englanders had treated
them better than any of the other colonists had done—a fact
strikingly exemplified in the life work of the Apostle John
Eliot, who translated the Bible into a written language rather
unskillfully invented for them by himself. Troubles arose in
connection with Alexander and Philip, two sons of Massasoit,
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
the friendly chief of the Pokanokets. Alexander died at
Plymouth, and Philip thought the colonists had poisoned him;
hence he planned a general Indian uprising, making his headquarters
on Mount Hope, a peninsula running into Narragansett
Bay. After many fiendish outrages had been committed on towns
in Plymouth and Massachusetts, the federal commissioners enlisted
a volunteer army. In December, 1675, this army attacked
a palisaded fort of the Indians at what is now South Kingston,
Rhode Island, and slew about one thousand warriors, half
the force within the walls. Philip still continued the struggle;
but the following August he was killed, to the great rejoicing
of the whole of New England; for the two years’ war, since
known as King Philip’s War (1675–1676), had been a frightful
experience.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s58'></a><span class='bold'>58. Loss of Massachusetts’ Charter.</span>—Their own king was
now to give the people of Massachusetts further trouble.
Massachusetts, by extending her dominion over New Hampshire
and Maine, had involved herself in disputes with the
proprietors of those colonies; Church of England people were
enraged at the fact that she would not tolerate their form
of religious service or give them the suffrage; she was also
charged with violating the navigation laws. Aggrieved at
these things, Charles made New Hampshire a royal province
in 1679; but his governor proved a tyrant, the people rebelled,
and in six years the sway of Massachusetts was resumed. Control
of Maine was lost for three years (1665–1668), but later on
Massachusetts shrewdly purchased the rights of the proprietors
over it. Charles intended to give Maine to his son, the
Duke of Monmouth, so he had an additional pretext for demanding
that Massachusetts should make a fair answer to all
his complaints—a course of action which the General Court of
the colony continued to evade. In 1684, weary of the evasions of
Massachusetts, he caused the old trading charter to be annulled.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s59'></a><span class='bold'>59. The Tyranny of Andros.</span>—Massachusetts was now a
royal colony, and in one year it exchanged masters for the
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
worse. James II. was a devoted Roman Catholic, who had no
sympathy with New England Puritans. In 1686 he sent over
Sir Edmund Andros,<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a>
as governor of Massachusetts,
Plymouth,
New Hampshire, and
Maine. Andros was
a servant worthy of
his master, vexatious
and tyrannical. He
demanded the charters
of Rhode Island and
Connecticut; his demand
was acceded to
in the former colony,
but in the latter it is
said that the important
document was hid at
Hartford, in a tree
since known as the
“Charter Oak.” The
governor was not to be
foiled, however, for he declared Connecticut to be under his
jurisdiction, and took in New York and the Jerseys (§ <a href='#s68'>68</a>)
as well. Thus he had the largest territory ever ruled by a
provincial governor in America. He held Episcopal services
in Congregational churches, suspended the writ of <span class='it'>habeas
corpus</span>, levied illegal taxes, and made himself thoroughly
obnoxious.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s60'></a><span class='bold'>60. Fall of Andros: New Charters.</span>—In the spring of 1689
news came of the accession of William and Mary, and the tyrant
of the colonies was driven out, just as James had been from England.
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
The old charters were restored for a time, but in 1691
Plymouth and Acadia (§ <a href='#fn47'>98, note 1</a>) were added to Massachusetts,
and in 1692 a new charter was given the colony. By
this instrument the people were still permitted to vote for representatives;
but the governor was appointed by the Crown,
and religious qualifications for the suffrage were abolished.
Massachusetts was allowed to keep Maine, but New Hampshire
was made a separate colony. Connecticut and Rhode Island
recovered their charters, and the century ended with New
England comparatively quiet and loyal.</p>

<h3 id='s61a'>DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIDDLE COLONIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s61'></a><span class='bold'>61. The Dutch Settlers.</span>—The Dutch West India Company
fared badly at the hands of its own members, the “Patroons,”
who shut it out from trading with their estates. It also had
trouble, as we have seen, with New Englanders at Hartford,
and likewise with the Virginians, who came trading as far
north as the Delaware River. With the Indians, too, there
were serious disturbances, chiefly with the Algonquins, through
the mismanagement of Governor Kieft (1643–1645).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s62'></a><span class='bold'>62. Attempts to check the Patroons.</span>—The Company sought
to check the power of the “Patroons” by establishing communities
more or less independent of them, but the attempt
did not thoroughly succeed. Political disturbances were also
due in large measure to the overbearing conduct of governors,
and to the lack of proper guarantees of popular liberty. In
1641, however, a council of twelve deputies from the settlements
was called in to assist the governor, and a little later,
under Peter Stuyvesant,<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a> this was made a self-perpetuating
council. Government was rendered specially difficult on account
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
of the mixture of population in the colony. For example,
so many French Huguenots had fled thither that documents
were often printed in
both French and Dutch.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s63'></a><span class='bold'>63. Swedish Settlement.</span>—Meanwhile
difficulties
arose between
the Dutch and the
Swedes; for in 1638
the South Company
of Sweden, which had
been chartered under
Gustavus Adolphus by
an enterprising man,
William Usselinx, sent
out a former employee
of the Dutch Company,
Peter Minuit, to found
a colony. He erected
a fort on the site of
what is now Wilmington,
Delaware, and
called the country New
Sweden, under the protests, of course, of the Dutch, whose
territorial claims had been invaded. New Englanders tried
to establish themselves on the Schuylkill and in the present
New Jersey, but were soon driven out. The Swedes persevered
until Stuyvesant built a fort near one of theirs, not far
from what is now Newcastle, Delaware; and four years later
(1655) the Swedish Company was forced to give up its attempt
at colonization.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s64'></a><span class='bold'>64. New York taken by the English.</span>—These successes of the
Dutch, and the fact that their territory cut off New England
from Virginia and gave Dutch traders, by means of the Hudson
River, the best possible opportunity of reaching the Indians,
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
made it impossible for England long to acquiesce in the continuance
of Dutch rule in the New World. There had already
been trouble in Connecticut, on Long Island, and on the Schuylkill
(§§ <a href='#s55'>55</a> and <a href='#s61'>61</a>), and things came nearly to a crisis in
1654, when Cromwell sent out a fleet to take New Netherland.
But peace between England and Holland delayed the crisis for
ten years. In 1664 Charles II., as we have seen (§ <a href='#s56'>56</a>), renewed
the English claim to the territory, and acting on his orders
Colonel Nicolls menaced New Amsterdam with a small fleet,
which carried English regulars and Connecticut volunteers.
Governor Stuyvesant wished to hold out, but the townsmen
surrendered in haste. The other Dutch settlements yielded
rapidly, and the whole Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida
thus became English. New Netherland was now called New
York, in honor of its proprietor, the Duke of York, Charles’s
brother—afterward James II. Nicolls was made governor,
and the prosperity of the colony was greatly augmented.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s65'></a><span class='bold'>65. Government of New York.</span>—Dutch customs were on the
whole little changed, but the form of government was modified
in accordance with English precedents. The towns were provided
with a local government, under an elected constable and
overseers. Several towns formed a “riding,”<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a> under the jurisdiction
of a sheriff; later, the ridings became counties. Thus
New York had an intermediate system between the town
government of New England and the county government of
Virginia (§§ <a href='#s82'>82</a> and <a href='#s89'>89</a>). The conduct of colonial affairs,
however, depended entirely on the governor and his council.
The early governors presented much the same contrasts of
character as had been seen in the other colonies. Some were
excellent, others were tyrannical. On the whole, the colony
managed to grow and prosper, although in 1673, when England
and Holland were at war, a Dutch fleet captured the town of
New York. The next year the province was given back to the
English by treaty, and, curiously enough, the first governor
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
under the new English rule—Edmund Andros, the later
tyrant of New England—gave the colonists an excellent administration.
After a few years the people clamored for greater
political privileges. An electoral assembly of deputies and
certain reforms were in consequence granted by the Duke of
York; but when he came to the throne as James II., he restored
the old illiberal system.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s66'></a><span class='bold'>66. Leisler’s Insurrection.</span>—Relief was at hand, however;
for on the news of the accession of William and Mary a German
shopkeeper, Jacob Leisler, put himself at the head of the militia
and drove out Francis Nicholson, who was acting as deputy for
Andros. Leisler was a rash patriot, who would not give up
his irregularly acquired power. Two years later he was forced
to surrender, and was executed under circumstances not altogether
creditable to the regular authorities. Leisler’s administration
is notable for his having issued a call for a colonial
congress, which came together at the town of New York, on
May 1, 1690, and discussed French and Indian affairs. After
Leisler, the people of New York suffered at the hands of a
corrupt governor, Benjamin Fletcher, who was in league with
the numerous pirates of the period; but at the end of the
century his successor, the Earl of Bellomont, put down piracy
and corruption, and restored order generally.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s67'></a><span class='bold'>67. The Settlement of the Jerseys.</span>—Meanwhile the country
south of New York and east of the Delaware River had acquired
the name of New Jersey, through the fact that in 1664
the Duke of York granted it to Lord Berkeley and Sir George
Carteret, the latter of whom had been governor of the island
of Jersey during the English civil war. The region for which
Dutch, Swedes, and English had already struggled was still
scantily populated; but the proprietors gave it a liberal form
of government, and sent out as first governor Philip Carteret,
nephew of Sir George, with a body of emigrants who settled at
Elizabeth.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s68'></a><span class='bold'>68. Disturbances in the Jerseys.</span>—Other settlers came in,
and by 1668 a code of laws of remarkable severity was adopted
by the delegates of the people. Disturbances arose over the
subject of the quit-rents paid by freeholders in discharge of
services, and Lord
Berkeley was so disgusted
that he sold
his share in the province
to certain Quakers
who wished to
secure for their co-religionists
a place
of refuge in the
New World. William
Penn<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a> and some associates
shortly afterward
acquired this
interest. Then a division
was made between
Carteret and
the new proprietors,
the Quakers getting
less than half, which
formed West New
Jersey. Here they
set up a liberal government, which attracted several hundred
immigrants. In 1682, two years after Carteret’s death, William
Penn and others purchased his interest in East New Jersey,
and established another liberal government. Governor Andros
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
of New York endeavored to assert his jurisdiction over both
the Jerseys, but his attempts were defeated until 1686, when
James II., by writs of <span class='it'>quo warranto</span>,<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a> forced the surrender of
the patents. The Jerseymen, however, resisted all Andros’s
attempts to tax them, and also quarreled with the proprietors,
whose land rights had not been affected by the loss of their
political powers. Finally, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, the proprietors, worn out with the struggle, surrendered
all their rights to the Crown, and the two provinces
were united into the royal colony of New Jersey.<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s69'></a><span class='bold'>69. The Founding of Pennsylvania.</span>—William Penn’s interest
in the colonization of West Jersey led to his taking a greater
part in American affairs. In 1670 his father, an admiral in
the English navy, died, and left him a claim against the government,
in compensation for which he induced Charles II. to
give him a charter for forty thousand square miles in America
(1681). This region was named Pennsylvania in honor of the
admiral, against the modest wishes of the proprietor. Penn at
once offered liberal terms to colonists, and promised a thoroughly
equitable government. Later in 1681, three shiploads
of Quakers emigrated, and the next year Penn himself came
over and founded Philadelphia. He soon convened an assembly,
and a code of laws was drawn up, allowing considerable
religious freedom and providing for the humane treatment of
the Indians. With these savages Penn, through his shrewdness
and kindness, was always successful in his negotiations, and as
a result Pennsylvania did not suffer from border warfare.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s70'></a><span class='bold'>70. Mixture of Population.</span>—The mixed population for which
Pennsylvania has been always noted was present from the
beginning. The Dutch had a church within the region now
known as Delaware, and settlements of Swedes also existed.
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
This Delaware region came into Penn’s hands through
a special grant from the Duke of York. When the whole
province was divided into counties, three were made in Pennsylvania
proper, and three in the small strip covered by the
Duke’s grant, which became known as “The Territories.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s71'></a><span class='bold'>71. Delaware made a Province.</span>—Penn was soon obliged to
return to England, and did not come back again till the end
of the century, when he paid a two years’ visit. His absence
was marked by considerable political disturbance. There were
boundary disputes with Maryland, and there was so much
trouble in “The Territories” that in 1703 Penn made the
latter the separate province of Delaware. Disputes in both
provinces continued, however, and lasted, under both him and
his heirs, down to the Revolution. Nevertheless, there was a
marked and continuous growth in material prosperity.</p>

<h3 id='s72a'>THE SOUTHERN COLONIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s72'></a><span class='bold'>72. The Settlement of the Carolinas.</span>—As we have seen,
attempts had been made to settle in the region between
Spanish Florida and Virginia, both by French Huguenots and
by Englishmen sent out by Raleigh. But all such efforts
had failed. After the founding of Jamestown, hunters and
other adventurous spirits wandered through southern Virginia
into what Charles I. subsequently granted to Sir Robert Heath
as “The Province of Carolina.” This grant was not used, but
the Virginia Burgesses authorized exploring expeditions into
the new region, and in 1653 some Virginian dissenters who
had been harshly treated formed a colony in North Carolina,
which they called Albemarle. Other parties, including Quakers
and individual settlers, gradually pushed into the section.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s73'></a><span class='bold'>73. Grant of the Carolinas to Clarendon and Berkeley.</span>—In 1663
Charles II. turned over the province to a group of favorites,
among whom were the famous historian, the Earl of Clarendon,
and Sir William Berkeley, the governor of Virginia. The settlers
of Albemarle had their land claims recognized, and were
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
given a governor in the person of William Drummond, a Scotchman
who had settled in Virginia. South of Albemarle, on the
Cape Fear River, a number of emigrants from the island of
Barbadoes had planted a colony, known as Clarendon, under
the leadership of Sir John Yeamans, who continued as governor
under the new proprietors. Thus there were a northern
and a southern Carolina almost from the first.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s74'></a><span class='bold'>74. Liberality of Proprietors.</span>—The proprietors were very
liberal to their colonists. Indeed, in the northern province
the first legislature actually felt bold enough to decree that no
debts contracted by settlers previous to their coming to Carolina
could be collected within its borders,—a proceeding which
naturally attracted some not very desirable immigrants.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s75'></a><span class='bold'>75. Locke’s Constitutions.</span>—But the proprietors made a great
mistake when they intrusted to the celebrated philosopher,
John Locke, the task of drawing up a scheme of government
for their provinces. He prepared a document known as the
“Fundamental Constitutions,” in which he seemed to forget
most of the advances toward individual and popular liberty
that had been made since the Middle Ages. Various divisions
of the territory were to be presided over by orders of nobility
known as Landgraves, Caciques, etc. The tenants were called
“leetmen,” and could not leave the estate of their lord without
his permission, nor could their children be anything but leetmen
through all generations. It is needless to say that this scheme
for a mediæval aristocracy in a land not yet cleared of forests
was doomed to failure, for it at once produced discontent in the
settlements, to which that of Charleston (originally Charlestown,
founded in 1670) was now added.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s76'></a><span class='bold'>76. Progress of the Carolinas.</span>—For some time the proprietors
left the settlers of Albemarle, or the North Carolinians, as we
may now call them, severely alone, and the people managed to
live by means of a rude sort of agriculture and by trade with New
England. When governors were appointed for them, troubles
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
at once ensued, and the legislature in 1688 actually drove out
Governor Seth Sothel, who by his corruption and tyranny had
amply deserved his fate. At Charleston, however, things went
much better, and population and trade increased, while the
arrival of considerable numbers of French Huguenots added
greatly to the moral and intellectual advancement of the settlers.
But there were some troubles. For example, the Scotch settlement
at Port Royal was completely destroyed by the Spaniards;
yet the proprietors would not allow the Carolinians to
chastise their enemy. Then, too, the Huguenots were for some
time denied political rights, and the numerous dissenters had
trouble with the Church of England people. Trade restrictions
and the constant presence of pirates in the harbor of
Charleston and on the coast were also a source of embarrassment.
Finally, there was a series of bad governors, and it was
not until 1695, when one of the proprietors, John Archdale,
a shrewd and good Quaker, came from England as governor,
that things began to improve.</p>

<h3 id='s77a'><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>GENERAL CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s77'></a><span class='bold'>77. Population.</span>—We have now learned that of the thirteen
original colonies that formed the United States, all except the
youngest, Georgia, had attained individual, or semi-individual,
existence by the end of the seventeenth century. The population
of New England in 1700 was about one hundred and five
thousand, Massachusetts, including Maine, leading with about
seventy thousand, and Connecticut coming second with about
twenty-five thousand. Rhode Island and New Hampshire were
much smaller, containing only six thousand and five thousand
respectively. Homogeneity, thrift, piety, and love of liberty
characterized the population of the New England colonies, and
were the presage of the great development the eighteenth century
was to see. The population of the Middle colonies in 1700
was about fifty-nine thousand, New York having twenty-five
thousand, the Jerseys fourteen thousand, and Pennsylvania
and Delaware about twenty thousand. Homogeneity was
characteristic of New Jersey alone, both New York and Pennsylvania
having very mixed populations. Thrift characterized
all the Middle region; but English enterprise was somewhat
tempered by Dutch phlegm and Quaker sobriety. In the
Southern colonies (if we may estimate from figures of 1688)
there were more than twenty-five thousand persons in Maryland,
sixty thousand in Virginia, and about five thousand in the
Carolinas. The English race was dominant, but the presence
of large numbers of black slaves, who were chiefly fit for work
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
in the fields, checked the enterprise of the whites by confining
it practically to agriculture.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s78'></a><span class='bold'>78. Social Conditions.</span>—With regard to social conditions,
the tendency in the South was to form an aristocracy, based
on race and the distinction between manual and other forms
of labor. In New England, too, there was an aristocracy, based
mainly on education and religion, but also on birth and wealth.
In the Middle colonies there were traces of an aristocracy in
the “Patroons” of New York and in the masters of the fairly
numerous negro slaves. But on the whole, manual labor was
held in esteem, and the population was democratic in its tendencies.</p>

<h3 id='s79a'>CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s79'></a><span class='bold'>79. Political Characteristics of New England.</span>—The aristocracy
of New England was unlike any other the world has ever seen.
Its members were energetic, unusually well-educated, serious,
and full of a sense of responsibility. They filled with distinction
the public offices and the professions, especially the
ministry. Precedence was allowed them by the merchants,
farmers, and mechanics through force of custom, not through
the presence of a caste system like that of slavery (although
a few slaves were owned), or through the force of laws derived
from the feudal system. As the masses of the people increased
in wealth and culture, and learned to use the opportunities
allowed them by the New World, the power of the aristocracy
naturally decreased, although it continued to exert considerable
influence well into the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s80'></a><span class='bold'>80. Professional Life.</span>—As was to be expected in such religious
communities, the clergy formed the most important
section of the aristocracy. They led in all public affairs, down
to the struggle for independence, and even beyond it, in spite
of the loosening of religious ties that began to make itself felt
in the eighteenth century. The other learned professions
did not at first reach corresponding importance. There were
hardly any trained barristers before the beginning of the
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
eighteenth century, although the magistrates were men of
good character and general education. The physicians, like
their European brethren, used strange drugs, and prescribed
heroic remedies which seem very queer to us now; and they
frequently combined their profession with that of the gospel
or with the trade of the barber.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s81'></a><span class='bold'>81. Mechanic Arts and Commerce.</span>—In the mechanical arts,
the New Englanders were more independent than the other
colonists. They imported elaborate manufactured products,
but supplied themselves with the simpler ones in spite of the
repressive effects of English laws. Among the most important
industries were mining, timber-cutting, tanning, and distilling.
Various needful commodities were manufactured in
small quantities, while almost every farmer’s family made
homespun cloth for its own consumption, as well as nails and
similar articles. Fishing was carried on at great profit, and
shipbuilding had developed considerably by the middle of the
seventeenth century. The whale fisheries were specially important
and attracted many adventurous men. The hardy sailors
made both coast and ocean voyages, the trade with the West
Indies being of great consequence, since from these islands
sugar and molasses were brought home and made into rum.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s82'></a><span class='bold'>82. Town Life in New England.</span>—Boston and New Haven
were the chief towns, and presented a prosperous appearance.
There were many well-kept villages, which were centers of
active political life, since those local affairs which were far
more important to the inhabitants than the more general business
of the colony, were settled by the citizens at town meetings.
The houses of the people were on the whole comfortable.
Each village had a school for the common branches, and soon
good Latin schools were provided. Puritan simplicity prevailed
in manners and dress, and, what was better, in conduct,
crime being rare. There is practically but one stain on New
England character during the early colonial period—the stain
of persecution. We have already seen its effects in the religious
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
intolerance displayed against churchmen and Quakers and independent
thinkers like Roger Williams; but at the end of the
seventeenth century it took an even worse form.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s83'></a><span class='bold'>83. The Persecution of the Witches.</span>—Owing to political disturbances,
fear of Indians, and the ravages of smallpox
epidemics, the inhabitants of Massachusetts, near the end of
the seventeenth century, were seized with great despondency.
In common with
many persons in England
and in Germany
they believed that the
Scriptural injunction,
“Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live,”
was binding upon
a modern Christian
community. Under
the impulse of this
belief they began a
persecution of many
citizens, chiefly old
women, for the supposed
crime of witchcraft.
Trials were
held, presided over
by learned magistrates;
the testimony
of frightened children was taken; and in Salem (1692) nineteen
persons were hanged, and one pressed to death. Hundreds of
others were arrested on suspicion, and for a time the colony
seemed completely to have lost its reason. Even such a distinguished
scholar and minister as Cotton Mather<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a> shared in the
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
frenzy and defended it. But Judge Samuel Sewall (now known
for a famous diary descriptive of the life of the period) made a
public recantation in church of his share in the frightful business.
It was indeed a terrible time, but New England emerged
from it safely, and could point in extenuation to many similar
outbreaks of popular frenzy in the Old World.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s84'></a><span class='bold'>84. Literature.</span>—It has been held, with much show of
truth, that only a people, gifted with imagination could have
been stirred into such a frenzied state of mind as characterized
the New Englanders during the persecution of the witches.
Unfortunately, their imaginative powers were employed too
exclusively upon religious and theological themes, with the
result that although much was written in New England during
the seventeenth century, little truly imaginative literature
was produced. Drama and fiction were non-existent, and the
verse written hardly rose to the dignity of poetry. Mrs.
Anne Bradstreet (1613–1672) and the Rev. Michael Wigglesworth
(1631–1705, author of a quaint, grewsome poem entitled
<span class='it'>The Day of Doom</span>) are almost the only poets worthy
of mention, and their works are unread to-day. There were,
on the other hand, many learned divines, like Thomas Hooker
(1586–1647), John Cotton (1585–1652), Roger Williams (1607–1684),
and Increase Mather (1639–1723), whose sermons and
religious tracts were widely read by their contemporaries; but
oblivion has fallen upon them also, save perhaps in the case
of Williams. Next in importance to theology stood history,
and among the historians the chief place must be given to
Governors William Bradford and John Winthrop, who wrote
the early annals of their respective colonies of Plymouth and
Massachusetts Bay. But probably the most able and distinguished
writer produced in America during the seventeenth
century was the celebrated divine already mentioned, Cotton
Mather (1663–1728), who was, as scholar, theologian, and historian,
an epitome of the learning of the age. His best-known
book, <span class='it'>Magnalia Christi Americana</span> (1702), is an ecclesiastical
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
history of New England that is of great value to all students
of early American annals. There was a little writing done in
the Middle and Southern colonies, but it did not differ in
quality from that done in New England and does not demand
attention here.</p>

<h3 id='s85a'>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIDDLE COLONIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s85'></a><span class='bold'>85. Social Classes and Occupations.</span>—The Middle colonies,
as we have seen, were in the main democratic, but the New
York “Patroons” on their estates asserted their privileges as
semi-feudal landlords, and in their town houses even lived in
comparative luxury. Among the Quakers, too, in the other colonies,
there were always some leading families that formed a
quasi-aristocracy. The professions, as in New England, commanded
the respect of the people, especially in Pennsylvania,
which attracted some well-educated settlers. The masses of
the people were engaged either in agriculture or in trade.
Fur was the most important article of export; but grain and
flour were also exported in return for foreign commodities.
Manufacturing was carried on in a small way, especially by
the Germans at Germantown, Pennsylvania. There was a
fair amount of coast and river trade; for the roads were quite
bad, except on the main post-line running from New York to
Philadelphia through New Jersey, and in consequence the
waterways were much used for purposes of transportation of
goods and travelers.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s86'></a><span class='bold'>86. Social and Political Life.</span>—With regard to social life
the Middle colonies were somewhat less sober than New
England. Dancing parties, corn-huskings, and the like festivities
diverted the country people; while the towns had
races, cock-fights, and other similar amusements of the period.
In point of elegance and fashion, New York was inferior to
Boston, but was superior to Philadelphia. The English predominated
in the towns; but the Dutch, with their sobriety,
neatness, and narrowness of life, dominated the country districts,
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
which did not extend much farther than Albany, or,
indeed, far away from the Hudson River. The settlers of the
outlying districts in both New York and Pennsylvania were
rude and simple in their manner of living—were, in fact, our
first backwoodsmen. Facilities for education were everywhere
far inferior to those of New England, although one or two good
schools existed in New York and Philadelphia. Religious
influences were much mixed, owing to the variety of creeds
tolerated; but Quaker sobriety was almost as strong as Puritan
rigor in suppressing Sabbath-breaking and other forms of
popular license. Politically, the Middle colonies were not so
stable and well governed as New England. In New York and
Pennsylvania taxes were heavy, and there was considerable
discontent against the colonial officials and the mother country.
Rioting at elections was frequent in New York. The
Quakers were naturally more peaceful; indeed, their reluctance
to bear arms partly prevented a complete union of the colonies
for self-defense against the Indians. But all things considered,
the Middle colonies in 1700 were in a prosperous
condition, and had laid a foundation for the immense wealth
and population they possess to-day.</p>

<h3 id='s87a'>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOUTHERN COLONIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s87'></a><span class='bold'>87. Mode of Life.</span>—The aristocracy of the Southern colonies
was based partly on birth, partly on slavery, and existed
chiefly because of the richness of the soil and of the fact that
the numerous waterways encouraged a system of practically
independent plantations. In many cases ocean-going ships
could come up to private wharves, be there loaded with tobacco,
indigo, rice, and other commodities, carry these to England,
and return laden with manufactured articles required by the
planters. It followed that retail trades and manufactures and
all save minor handicrafts were practically non-existent in the
South. Towns were hardly to be found. Jamestown was
the seat of government in Virginia, and was resorted to by
the wealthier planters for the purposes of fashion and pleasure,
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
Williamsburg taking its place later; but for a long time
Charleston was the only settlement in the South that exhibited
real town life. Another result of the independent plantation
system was the paucity of schools, as well as the feeble state of
the Church. The richer planters employed private tutors, and
often sent their sons to English universities. The middle and
lower classes got practically no education. The clergy, except
in South Carolina, were, as a rule, illiterate and were often
immoral in conduct. The other learned professions were at a
low ebb also, and education and culture were almost entirely
confined to a few privileged persons.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s88'></a><span class='bold'>88. Social Classes in the South.</span>—There were four classes of
society, separated by sharp distinctions. Lowest of all came
the black slaves,<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a> who increased rapidly in Virginia after 1650,
were numerous in Maryland, and preponderant in South Carolina.
They were, on the whole, fairly well treated, though
much overworked in South Carolina. Toward the end of the
seventeenth century a very severe code of laws with regard to
them came into existence; but it is not likely, however, that
the cruel punishments allowed were often inflicted. Above the
blacks were the indented white servants, who frequently came
of the English criminal classes and were treated more or less
harshly. Then came the small farmers and mechanics, who
had little education, were fond of rough sports, and were somewhat
looked down on by the planters. They possessed sturdy
English virtues, however, and were jealous of their independence.
The highest class, the planters, were often gentlemen
of excellent birth, courteous manners, and vigorous qualities
of mind and heart. Although keeping up many ties with
the mother country, they were by no means subservient to it,
and in political matters often resisted the colonial governors.
From them were recruited many of the revolutionary leaders.
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s89'></a><span class='bold'>89. Isolation of the South.</span>—Thus we see that there was nothing
in the South to correspond with the town life of New England,
with its enterprise, or with its educational and religious
solidarity. There was nothing to correspond with the thrift
of the Middle colonies. Isolation was the rule, in agriculture,
commerce, and even in matters of administration. The
administrative unit was the large county, hence local government
was always difficult and somewhat inefficient. Society
in many respects reproduced feudal aspects; but this lack of
social solidarity was not without beneficial results. It fostered
a love of independence, a fondness for manly sports, and a self-reliance
that were to stand the people in good stead during the
trials of the Revolution and of the Civil War.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s90'></a><span class='bold'>90. General View of the Colonists.</span>—On the whole, we may conclude
that the English colonists at the end of the seventeenth
century had made remarkable progress. They had secured
firm hold of the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida, and
had absorbed the rival settlements of the Dutch and Swedes.
They had pushed the Indians back and laid the foundations
of national wealth in agriculture, manufacturing, fishing, and
commerce. They had developed a spirit of independence and
of moral sobriety, and had not allowed their intellectual powers
to decline. They were increasing rapidly in numbers, and
only their French and Indian foes remained to dispute their
possession of the central portion of the continent.</p>

<h3 id='s91a'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>COLONIAL DISPUTES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s91'></a><span class='bold'>91. Character of the Period.</span>—During the first quarter, or
indeed the first half of the eighteenth century, colonial history
contains few salient features apart from boundary disputes,
quarrels with royal governors, and struggles with the
French and Indians. There was a steady growth in numbers,
which may be measured by the fact that from the first to the
middle of the century New England increased fourfold, the
Middle colonies sixfold, and the Southern colonies sevenfold in
population. Wealth and general prosperity increased in fair
proportion also. During such a period of development historians
rarely find events of a startling or romantic nature to
chronicle.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s92'></a><span class='bold'>92. Charters in Danger.</span>—The people of the various colonies
were, however, disturbed from time to time by political events
that were of considerable importance to them, as, for instance,
by the attacks made in England upon their charters. These
were in the main successfully warded off by the colonial agents
in London, but they sometimes became serious. For example,
it was proposed in 1715 to annex Rhode Island and Connecticut,
which had liberal charters, to the royal colony of New
Hampshire, which had no charter at all. In the case of the
Carolinas, the proprietors, when threatened with a writ of
<span class='it'>quo warranto</span> on account of popular disturbances in their territories,
surrendered their charters to the Crown for a compensation.
Thereafter royal governors were sent to both South
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
and North Carolina, the latter province having to that time
been under a deputy of the governor of the former.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s93'></a><span class='bold'>93. Boundary Disputes.</span>—Boundary disputes were very bitter
between the colonies and continued, after they became states,
into the nineteenth century. Connecticut especially was involved
in frequent quarrels with her neighbors. New York
and New Hampshire also had disputes with regard to the
territory adjoining Lake Champlain. Some of the settlers of
this region revolted just before the Revolution, in order to
establish an independent government, which was recognized in
1777 as the state of Vermont. Pennsylvania and Maryland
likewise had a dispute, which was settled by the drawing of
the famous Mason and Dixon Line (1763–1767). To the south
there were boundary disputes with Spain and to the west with
France. The latter were to lead to serious results.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s94'></a><span class='bold'>94. Quarrels with Governors.</span>—The disputes between the colonies
and their governors were numerous and bitter. Frequently
the point at issue touched upon the payment of a regular
salary to the governor by the colony, the colonists preferring
to keep him dependent upon them by voting him supplies at
irregular intervals. They argued correctly that fixed payments
would be equivalent to a tax levied by the Crown, and
they held out bravely, especially in Massachusetts, against all
efforts on the part of the English government to force them
to submit. We have already seen that some disagreements
were based upon the corruption of governors, their dealings with
pirates, and their general tendency to tyranny. Sometimes,
as in South Carolina after the middle of the century, the governor
would oppose a pernicious policy like the rash issuing
of paper money, and would thus incur popular displeasure.
Or he would become unpopular merely as the instrument
through which the English government or the proprietors
endeavored to carry out some obnoxious measure. Religious
persecution of dissenters, when attempted by the governor,
was sure to earn him hatred in all quarters, as in the case of
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
Lord Cornbury in New York and New Jersey (1702–1708).
Probably the disputes carried on by the Pennsylvanians against
their executives over questions of taxation, etc., were more
heated than those of any other colony.</p>

<h3 id='s95a'>VIRGINIA AND GEORGIA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s95'></a><span class='bold'>95. A Successful Governor.</span>—There was, however, at least
one thoroughly honest and efficient governor. This was Alexander
Spotswood, who came out in 1710 to Virginia. He was
a bluff, energetic soldier, who had been wounded at Blenheim.
His coming was especially gratifying to the Virginians, since
he brought them the long-craved privileges of the writ of
<span class='it'>habeas corpus</span>. But even Spotswood found it difficult to extort
money from the Burgesses in order to prepare for defenses
against an expected French invasion. He did not, however,
allow this opposition to render him indifferent to the interests
of the colony. He sought especially to develop its mineral
resources, and caused blast furnaces to be erected,—the first in
the colonies. He also imported Germans to develop the vineyards,
which were necessary to his scheme for making Virginia
a wine-producing country. He furthermore showed his interest
in the Indians by establishing a school mission.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s96'></a><span class='bold'>96. The Crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</span>—The most
memorable event connected with Governor Spotswood’s administration
is his romantic expedition across the Blue Ridge.
Little or nothing was known of the beautiful valley beyond
these mountains. Spotswood set out in August, 1716, with a
large cavalcade, well furnished with hunting equipments, and,
according to the fashion of the times, with a quantity and
variety of liquors that would now be thought excessive. It
was a good deal of a frolic; but it resulted in the discovery of
the splendid valley of the Shenandoah, to which river the governor
gave the rather inappropriate name of the Euphrates.
This region was destined soon to be settled by thrifty German
colonists, and it has ever since been considered the garden spot
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
of Virginia.<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a> Spotswood commemorated his expedition by presenting
his companions with small golden horseshoes set with
jewels. He had to pay for these himself, since King George I.
was probably not anxious to encourage even such worthy
colonial orders of knighthood as the “Knights of the Golden
Horseshoe.” The king thought, perhaps, that his trusty servant
did him a better
service when two years
later he sent out two
armed ships, which conquered
and rid the colonies
of the notorious
pirate John Theach,
otherwise known as
“Blackbeard.”</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>James Oglethorpe.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s97'></a><span class='bold'>97. The Colonization
of Georgia.</span>—The country
between the Savannah
River and the St.
John’s River in Florida,
was claimed by the
English; and when the
Carolinas became royal
provinces, this region
was reserved as crown
land. It soon attracted
the attention of a noble-minded Englishman, James Oglethorpe.<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a>
He conceived the idea that it would be an excellent
place in which to establish a colony to be composed of
such persons as needed a new chance in life after having been
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
released from the then crowded debtor prisons of England.
He secured the aid of a company in establishing his proposed
colony, which was also intended to serve as a bulwark against
the Spanish colony of St. Augustine and as an important outpost
of the fur trade. The colony was styled Georgia, in honor
of King George II. The company of proprietors were very
liberal; they prohibited slavery and religious persecution, and
provided that none of their own number should hold a salaried
office. Oglethorpe came out in November, 1732, and early in
the following year founded the town of Savannah. He treated
the Indians well and made a firm alliance with them. In 1734
a number of German settlers arrived and added much stability
to the colony. This same year Augusta was founded as an
armed trading-post, and soon became the center of a large fur
traffic. The English debtors, however, were not the best of
colonists, and the company was wise enough to induce more
Germans and some Scotch Highlanders to seek the colony.
After this the growth of Georgia was certain, but very slow;
for even so benevolent an enterprise could not escape internal
discontent and friction, due largely to the thriftless character
of the English beneficiaries.</p>

<h3 id='s98a'>FRENCH DISCOVERIES AND CLAIMS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s98'></a><span class='bold'>98. French Exploration of the Mississippi Valley.</span>—From the
beginning, the French colonists settled in Acadia<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a> and New
France<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[48]</span></sup></a> succeeded in making friends with the Indians, to an
extent rarely equaled by the English. But friendship with
the Hurons and Algonquins involved enmity with the enemies
of the latter, the Iroquois. This in turn meant that the French
would have great difficulty in penetrating New York. It also
meant that their explorations would at first penetrate the
western region bordered by Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
In this region they heard rumors of the Mississippi River,
and in 1673 a Jesuit priest, Père Marquette, and Louis Joliet,
a trader, undertook to look for it. With incomparable resolution
Marquette surmounted every difficulty, and finally with
his companions floated down the Wisconsin River into the
mighty Mississippi, which they followed to a point below the
Arkansas. Then they
made their arduous way
back, having accomplished
one of the most
magnificent voyages of
exploration known in
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s99'></a><span class='bold'>99. The Explorations
of La Salle.</span>—Their work
was finished ten years
later by Robert de la
Salle,<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[49]</span></sup></a> who with his
companions crossed from
Lake Erie to the Illinois
River and, after enduring
many hardships,
tracked the Mississippi
southward to the Gulf
of Mexico. There, taking possession of the region for Louis
XIV. of France, La Salle named it Louisiana in his honor. He
had been about four years at his work, in which he had
shown a courage that has made him memorable. Two years
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
later, in 1684, he sailed from France to plant a colony
on the Mississippi; but, missing its mouth, landed on the
coast of Texas. Here a fort was built, and from its occupation
France got her claim to the territory as far as the Rio
Grande. La Salle and his party, after suffering many hardships,
determined to separate into two bands. The party led
by La Salle murdered their brave commander, and finally
reached the Illinois River.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s100'></a><span class='bold'>100. French and English Claims.</span>—Thus France, through the
labors of her loyal subjects, had established a claim to an
enormous region stretching from the mouth of the St. Lawrence,
around the English colonies, to the mouth of the Mississippi,
and thence to the Rio Grande. East and west the
boundaries were practically the Alleghany and the Rocky
mountains. But these claims were sure to be resisted, for the
charters of the English colonies gave them almost indefinite
rights to the westward, and they were growing too fast to
be long cooped up between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic.
Before the close of the seventeenth century, the struggle for
predominance in the Mississippi Valley had begun, and in about
seventy-five years France had been stripped of all the possessions
which had been secured for her by the intrepidity and
foresight of leaders who had often been but ill-supported by
their king and government.</p>

<h3 id='s101a'>WARS WITH THE FRENCH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s101'></a><span class='bold'>101. King William’s War (1690–1697).</span>—The colonial wars
against the French for the possession of the region west of the
Alleghanies are known by the names of the English sovereigns
reigning at the time of hostilities; but they practically coincide
with important European wars. For example, the first break
in the American struggle corresponded with the famous Peace
of Ryswick (1697). Indeed, throughout the eighteenth century
colonial questions formed a most important factor in the
numerous and destructive wars waged in Europe. The French
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
early began to see that war must soon arise between the English
colonists and their own, and about the time of the revolution
which brought in William and Mary (1689), they sent over the
able Count Frontenac with instructions to overrun New York.
At first he had to beat off the Iroquois; but in 1690 he began
that long series of horrible raids, conducted by mixed bands of
French and Indians, which gives such a bloody tinge to the
annals of the times and accounts for the hatred cherished for
both their Christian and their savage enemies by the English
colonists. First it was Schenectady, New York, that was burned
and laid waste; then Salmon Falls, New Hampshire; then
Fort Loyal (now Portland, Maine); then Exeter, New Hampshire.
No one knew where the blow might fall next. Panic
reigned among the colonies, and a meeting of delegates from
several of them was held at Albany, in February, 1690, to discuss
the situation (§ <a href='#s66'>66</a>). A threefold attack on the French
possessions was planned, but only that against Port Royal in
Acadia, led by Sir William Phips, governor of Massachusetts,
was successful. Having destroyed Port Royal, he attempted
to take Quebec, while another body of troops attacked Montreal.
Both expeditions were failures, and, as a result, the French
ravages continued until the Peace of Ryswick, in 1697.
Neither side had gained ground, but the English had suffered
terribly. Massacres of the inhabitants of frontier towns made
life a terror to the pioneers, and in 1697 the invaders actually
sacked Haverhill, not thirty miles from Boston.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s102'></a><span class='bold'>102. Queen Anne’s War (1702–1713).</span>—Peace did not last
long, for William III. was resolute in opposing the aggressions
of Louis XIV. His policy was carried on after his death (in
1702) by the advisers of his successor, Queen Anne, chief
among whom was the famous Duke of Marlborough, the victor
of Blenheim. Massacres soon began again in New England.
Port Royal was attacked unsuccessfully in 1707 and
successfully in 1710, and another expedition to Quebec came
to nothing. The Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, put a stop to
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
hostilities, and this time the English diplomats were sufficiently
resolute to retain Acadia. Thenceforth Port Royal,
or Annapolis, as it was now named in honor of the queen, was
held by the English.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s103'></a><span class='bold'>103. Colonies at Peace: the “Great Awakening.”</span>—Peace was
to last for thirty years, a period which the French improved by
exploring expeditions and
by the building of forts
to secure the great region
watered by the Mississippi.
Nor did the English lose
sight of the vast interests
at stake. They did perhaps
the best thing to be
done under the circumstances—they
waited and
grew strong in numbers
and wealth, filling out as
well as possible their more
compact territory. They
experienced also a spiritual
awakening that must have
strengthened the popular
character in many ways.
This was the “Great Awakening” which, beginning early in the
century, became especially potent in 1734 under the preaching of
the famous Jonathan Edwards<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[50]</span></sup></a> at Northampton, Massachusetts.
The religious enthusiasm spread far and wide, and after a short
lull, began, in 1739–1740, to flame out afresh under the inspiration
of the great revivalist, George Whitefield. This eloquent
English preacher went to Georgia to join John and Charles Wesley,
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
and there carried on the religious work which the brothers
had begun. Whitefield preached throughout the colonies,
stirring men everywhere, and undoubtedly producing many
good results in spite of the evil consequences which a period
of excitement always leaves behind it.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s104'></a><span class='bold'>104. Establishment of French Forts.</span>—After the Peace of
Ryswick, Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, established a
French settlement at Biloxi, in the present state of Mississippi.
La Salle had previously built Fort St. Louis on the Illinois
River, and it was now the French policy to fill up the territory
between these two points with a chain of forts and settlements.
Mobile was founded in 1702, New Orleans in 1718. The
founder of New Orleans was Iberville’s brother, Bienville. At
the other end of the line Detroit was founded in 1701, Fort
Niagara was built in 1726, and Crown Point was erected on
Lake Champlain in 1731. In order that Acadia might be won
back if possible, the strong fortress of Louisburg was erected
on Cape Breton Island.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s105'></a><span class='bold'>105. King George’s War (1744–1748).</span>—In 1744 the war
known in Europe as the War of the Austrian Succession, and
in America as King George’s War, was begun by a successful
French attack on an English post in Nova Scotia, and by an
unsuccessful attempt to take Annapolis. Great efforts were
now made by Governor Shirley of Massachusetts to save Nova
Scotia. He applied to the English king, but his main reliance
was upon Massachusetts and her sister colonies of New England.
In the spring of 1745, just one year after the commencement
of hostilities, a large expedition set out to capture
Louisburg, and after a siege of six weeks took that redoubtable
fortress. The victory was celebrated in many long and sincere
prayers of thanksgiving and in some remarkably bad poetry.
But the English government was so blind to the importance of
the interest at stake as to restore Louisburg to the French at
the close of the war, in 1748.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s106'></a><span class='bold'>106. The French in the Ohio Valley.</span>—The French now
turned their attention to the task of securing the region
watered by the Ohio River. In 1749 Céloron de Bienville,
under orders of the governor of Canada, by means of canoe
voyages and portages,
reached Chautauqua Lake
and thence the Allegheny
River, where formal possession
of the country was
taken in the name of Louis
XV. of France. Leaden
plates with inscriptions asserting
the French claim
were interred at various
points along the Ohio and
its tributaries. Three years
later a chain of forts was
begun along the route taken
by Bienville, the first erected
being that of Presque Isle,
near the present city of Erie.
These movements of the
French alarmed the English colonists greatly, and, most of all,
Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia. This executive was interested
in an American scheme for settling the Ohio region, through the
agency of the so-called Ohio Company, and his colony claimed
the country now threatened by the French. As soon as he
heard of the new fort, he dispatched George Washington to
demand the withdrawal of the French. Washington was just
twenty-one years old, but he had seen life as a surveyor in the
frontier counties of Virginia, and had learned to command
men and to understand Indian character.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s107'></a><span class='bold'>107. Washington in the West.</span>—Washington, who was already
an adjutant general, took with him only a few companions on
his winter journey of seven hundred and fifty miles through
the perilous wilderness. He braved numerous dangers, which
he set down modestly in a journal that is still preserved.
His training as a surveyor enabled him to pick out as a proper
site for a fort the spot at the junction of the Allegheny and
Monongahela rivers where Fort Duquesne was shortly afterward
built by the French, and where Pittsburg now stands.
He reached Fort Le Bœuf (near the present Waterford,
Pennsylvania) and gave his letter to the French commandant.
The latter promised to send it on to the governor of Canada,
but continued to occupy the fort. On his return journey
Washington nearly lost his life while attempting to cross the
Monongahela on a raft; but he finally reached Williamsburg
in safety, having been absent only eleven weeks.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s108'></a><span class='bold'>108. Founding of Fort Duquesne.</span>—Dinwiddie determined to
take possession of the Forks of the Ohio at once. William
Trent, a trader, and some militia were hurried forward and
began the erection of a fort. While the Virginians were thus
occupied, and in the absence of their leader, a party of Frenchmen
and Indians descended upon them and they were forced to
surrender, their conquerors finishing the fort and naming it
after Duquesne, the governor of Canada.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s109'></a><span class='bold'>109. Washington at Fort Necessity.</span>—Meanwhile great preparations
had been made in Virginia. Washington, now lieutenant
colonel, set out with a few troops to aid Trent, but heard of
the surrender shortly after starting. He would not go back,
but pushed on into southwestern Pennsylvania, and there at a
place called Great Meadows began a fort. Having been warned
of the approach of a party of French, he attacked them suddenly
and completely routed them. Then he pushed on to the Ohio,
but on learning that the French were advancing in numbers,
finally fell back on his stockade, which he had called Fort
Necessity. Here the French and Indians attacked him vigorously,
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
and after a brave struggle he surrendered honorably on
July 4, 1754.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s110'></a><span class='bold'>110. The French and Indian War (1754–1763).</span>—This was
practically the beginning of what is generally called the
French and Indian War, which nearly coincides with the Seven
Years’ War in Europe. Both sides made extensive preparations,
for the fate of a continent was now plainly seen to be
in the balance. A congress of delegates from the colonies met
at Albany to make a treaty with the Iroquois, and here (1754)
Benjamin Franklin secured the adoption of a plan for a union of
the colonies. The scheme was not approved, however, when
submitted to the individual colonies, which were more or less
jealous of their privileges. But if the colonists would not join
to repel the foe, the English under Pitt were determined to
do their best to drive out the French, not foreseeing that as a
result the colonists, freed from danger at home, would be likely
in a short time to form a union to secure independence. They
sent out one of their ablest officers, Major General Edward
Braddock, and an elaborate plan of campaign was determined
on at a conference of the colonial governors assembled by
him at Alexandria, Virginia. Four expeditions were to be
made: one to be directed against Fort Crown Point in New
York, and thence against Quebec; another, from New England,
by water, against the French possessions in the northeast; the
third, from Albany against Niagara; the fourth, from Fort
Cumberland in Maryland against Fort Duquesne.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s111'></a><span class='bold'>111. Braddock’s Defeat.</span>—General Braddock decided to take
charge of the last-named expedition. His European training
had not qualified him to command in an unsettled country, and
in spite of his personal efforts he found great difficulty in moving
regular troops and artillery through the wilderness. He
could hardly have moved at all if Franklin had not persuaded the
Pennsylvania farmers to hire out their horses and wagons. In
June, 1755, the army began to cut its way through the forest. All
went well, though slowly, until the fort was nearly reached, when
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
suddenly (July 9, 1755) the advanced guard came upon a large
body of French and Indians. These wily foes immediately
adopted border habits of warfare, and picked off their enemies
from behind trees. Braddock, who had all an Englishman’s
contempt for colonial ways, pronounced this method of fighting
barbarous, and would not allow his men to imitate it. He insisted
on using the same tactics in the backwoods of America
that he had been accustomed to employ on the battlefields of
Europe. There could be but one result. His men offered
themselves as targets until so many were killed that a retreat
had to be sounded. Even this would have been unavailing but
for the fact that Washington, who was present as an aid-de-camp
and had vigorously protested against his superior’s hard-headedness,
used his Virginians, who had fought their enemies
in backwoods fashion, to cover the retreat of the regulars.
Washington performed many feats of valor throughout the
day, and had several narrow escapes. Braddock, quite as brave,
but entirely out of place in such a situation, was wounded just
before the retreat, and died a few days later. Thus the most
important of the four expeditions was a failure.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s112'></a><span class='bold'>112. Acadia, Crown Point, and Niagara.</span>—The second expedition
succeeded in dispersing several thousands of the poor

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s113'></a><span class='bold'>113. Effects of Pitt’s Policy.</span>—Although there had been
plenty of fighting along the American frontier, war was not
formally declared between Great Britain and France until
May, 1756. The French sent over a very able soldier, the
Marquis of Montcalm,<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[53]</span></sup></a> who was quite successful for about
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
two years, and might have been altogether so but for the
energy and foresight of that great English statesman, William
Pitt.<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[54]</span></sup></a> Pitt saw more clearly
than any other man of his
time how important her
colonial empire was to Great
Britain, and how it could
best be maintained and extended.
He supported Frederick
the Great on the
Continent, and caused renewed
efforts to be made in
America against the French.
The fourfold attack of a few
years before was again tried,
with almost complete success.
In 1758 Louisburg
was forced to surrender;
Washington captured Fort
Duquesne (afterward Fort
Pitt), and Fort Frontenac
on Lake Ontario was destroyed. Thus the Ohio region was cut
off from Quebec; but by resisting an attack on Ticonderoga,
Montcalm managed to keep the French forces wedged into
New York.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s114'></a><span class='bold'>114. The Fall of Quebec.</span>—The next year saw the practical
conclusion of the struggle, in the fall of Quebec. This again
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
was due indirectly to Pitt. He put James Wolfe<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56]</span></sup></a> in command
of an expedition against Quebec, by way of the St.

Lawrence. Wolfe landed with his troops below the city, which,
rising from the summit of its precipitous hill, seemed to be
impregnable. But the
young general was
dauntless. He performed
the extraordinary
feat of passing
up the river under
the guns of Montcalm,
and landing his
troops. During the
night they climbed
the cliffs, and by
dawn were ready to
offer battle on the
Plains of Abraham
(September 13, 1759).
The conflict was hotly
waged, the British
eventually securing
the victory, at the
cost of their brave
general, whose equally brave rival, Montcalm, was also killed.
It would be hard to estimate the consequences of this battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s115'></a><span class='bold'>115. The Treaty of Paris (1763).</span>—The fall of Quebec had
been preceded by the capture of the posts of Crown Point and
Ticonderoga held by the French within New York. It was
followed the next year by the taking of Montreal. This practically
closed the war in America, but peace was not declared
until 1763, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. By these
victories and the peace which followed them, Great Britain
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
obtained Canada and Cape Breton, nearly all the islands of
the St. Lawrence, and all the territory east of a line running
down the middle of the Mississippi River to a point just
above New Orleans. Spain received all the French possessions
west of this line, together with New Orleans. In return for
Havana, which had been taken by the English, Spain gave up
Florida to Great Britain.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s116'></a><span class='bold'>116. The New Provinces.</span>—The newly acquired territory was
divided into three provinces. Canada became the Province
of Quebec, part of its southern boundary line limiting the
present states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and
Maine. Florida was divided into two provinces, East and
West Florida. A line was also drawn around the head waters
of all the Atlantic-flowing rivers in the colonies, and the
colonists were forbidden to settle in the reserved territory,
which was set apart for the Indians. To defend these new
provinces it was resolved to maintain within their borders a
force of ten thousand men, who were to be supported partly
by the Crown and partly by the colonies. That troops were
needed was proved by the harassing though unsuccessful siege
of Detroit by the Indians, led by Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas,
in the spring and summer of 1763.</p>

<h3 id='s117a'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>GENERAL CAUSES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s117'></a><span class='bold'>117. Tendencies toward Separation.</span>—From the first there
were certain conditions that tended to force the American
colonies away from the mother country. The colonists, especially
those of New England, had very generally left Great
Britain for the purpose of escaping oppression; and, after the
new settlements were made, the conduct of the home government
was not such as to diminish the sense of wrong. It was
less than thirty years after the landing at Plymouth when the
first of the “Navigation Acts” marked the beginning of a
policy designed to encourage British at the expense of colonial
commerce (§ <a href='#s43'>43</a>), and in 1672 this unwise course of action
was carried still further. A law was passed which imposed
the same duties on trade between one colony and another as on
trade between America and foreign countries; and to enforce
this law, custom-houses were established along the border
lines between the different colonies. This naturally led to a
constant and a growing friction between the royal governors
who had to collect the revenue, and the colonists who had to
pay it. The seventy-five years immediately before the Seven
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
Years’ War are full of instances of the unfriendly relations
between the people and the agents of the home government<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[57]</span></sup></a>
(§<a href='#s94'>94</a>).</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/p88.jpg' alt='' id='p88' style='width:300px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>George III.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s118'></a><span class='bold'>118. Influence of the Seven Years’ War.</span>—These unfriendly
relations were happily interrupted by the war which resulted
in the fall of Quebec and the transfer of Canada from the
French to the English. The fact that the Americans were
united with the English in a common cause against a common
enemy drew them nearer and nearer together. In the prosecution
of the war the colonists bore a prominent and honorable
part, and at its close they everywhere shared in the general rejoicing.
In this spirit old Fort Duquesne was given the name
Pittsburg, in honor of the great statesman who had accomplished
so much for the continent; and the legislature of
Massachusetts voted for Westminster Abbey an elaborate
monument to Lord Howe, who had fallen at Ticonderoga.
It is certain that a new spirit of loyalty and devotion to the
mother country had sprung up, when in 1760, one year after
the fall of Quebec, George III., then a young man of twenty-two,
ascended the throne. He had a great opportunity to conciliate
the colonists and to increase their growing affection;
but he defiantly took the opposite course.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s119'></a><span class='bold'>119. George III.</span><a id='r58'/><a href='#f58' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[58]</span></sup></a>—The young king brought to the throne
a very unfortunate mixture of good and bad qualities. He had
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
an unblemished character; he had a strong will and was very
conscientious and industrious; but he was possessed with the
idea that the power of the throne should be greatly strengthened,
and that all opposition to such increase of power should
be put down, if need be, by main force. His ambition was to
restore to the Crown the power which it had unlawfully exercised
before the two English revolutions had made it subordinate
to Parliament. For the accomplishment of this purpose
he committed the fatal blunder of pushing aside the great
statesmen he found in office and of surrounding himself
with ministers who would aid him in carrying out his own
policy.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s120'></a><span class='bold'>120. Independent Spirit among the Colonies.</span>—Another peculiarity
of the situation was the prevalence of a decided spirit of
independence of one another among the individual colonies.
No effort to bring them together for purposes of common action,
even against the Indians, had been successful. Even Franklin’s
plan in 1754 had failed to unite them (§ <a href='#s110'>110</a>). On the
contrary, they had drawn farther and farther apart, so that
a very intelligent traveler, who had visited various parts of the
country, wrote in 1760, “Were the colonies left to themselves,
there would soon be civil war from one end of the continent to
the other.” And James Otis, one of the foremost of American
patriots, said in 1765, “Were the colonies left to themselves,
to-morrow America would be a mere shambles of blood and confusion
before the little petty states could be united.” When
George III. ascended the throne, the colonies seemed more
afraid of one another than they were of England, and more
likely to drift into separate nationalities like those of Europe
than they were to unite in a common effort to secure independence
of the mother country.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span></p>

<h3 id='s121a'>THE QUESTION OF TAXATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s121'></a><span class='bold'>121. Excuse for the Policy.</span>—The energetic and fatal policy
of the Crown first showed itself in a determination to impose
additional taxes on the Americans. There was some excuse
for this policy. The Seven Years’ War had been carried on at
heavy expense, and a large debt had been the result. The
king claimed that this burden, chiefly incurred in an effort to
protect the American colonists, should be borne, in large part,
by the colonists themselves. To this claim the colonists might
not have objected, if they had themselves been allowed a voice
in determining their share of the tax. But the English insisted
upon determining it without colonial advice.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s122'></a><span class='bold'>122. The British View of the Matter.</span>—In the course of
centuries the British people had come to recognize the principle,
“No taxation without representation.” But in the time
of George III. representation, even in England, was absurdly
imperfect. Boroughs of not more than half a dozen voters
sometimes sent two members to the British Parliament, while
some large towns like Manchester and Birmingham sent no
representatives. The people permitted this bad state of affairs
to continue, because the doctrine was held that every member
of Parliament, no matter by whom he was elected, represented
all the people of the kingdom, and not merely those who had
chosen him. According to this theory, the colonies were as
much represented in Parliament as Manchester and Birmingham;
and if those towns could be taxed without direct representation,
there appeared no just reason why Massachusetts and
Virginia and the other colonies should complain of the same
method.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s123'></a><span class='bold'>123. The Colonial View of the Case.</span>—But the colonists, and a
small but very influential minority in Parliament, took another
view of the case. Many of the colonies had been settled by
men who had come to America for the purpose of escaping
from a system which they regarded as unfair and tyrannical.
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
Two revolutions in England had established the authority of
Parliament as against the individual will of the king, but the
methods of representation had not been changed. Indeed,
they were worse than they had been when the Puritans came
to New England, more than a hundred years before. During
the intervening period the colonists had been receiving a
liberal education in matters of government. In their town
meetings and their provincial legislatures they had had to
consider and decide a vast number of subjects, until they very
naturally came to think they could understand the real requirements
of the country far better than could a Parliament three
thousand miles away. Some of the colonial writers denied that
the British had the legal right to tax the Americans, while
others claimed that, even if they had the legal right, an enforcement
of that right would be contrary to the whole spirit of
English liberty, and ought to be resisted.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s124'></a><span class='bold'>124. Folly of the British Government.</span>—If the British government
had been wise, these differences might have been reconciled;
but George III. and the friends whom he called about
him could not see why Boston, New York, and Philadelphia
should object to taxation while Birmingham and Manchester
did not. The fact remained, however, that the colonies did
object, and this important difference any wise government
would have seen and taken into account. But George III.
stubbornly held that if the colonies resisted the supreme
authority of the king and Parliament, they must simply be
forced into obedience. This doctrine, for which the king, and
the king alone, was responsible, was the fatal error that cost
Great Britain the American colonies.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s125'></a><span class='bold'>125. Grenville’s Scheme of Taxation.</span>—In 1764 Parliament,
under the leadership of Lord Grenville, made a formal
declaration that it had a right to tax the colonies, and a
year later proposed to raise a tax by what was known as the
“Stamp Act.” This provided that all transactions, to be lawful,
must be printed, or written, on paper furnished by the
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
government and bearing the government stamp. Even
newspapers and almanacs had to be printed on this stamped
paper. The cost of
the stamps varied
from a few cents
to fifty or sixty
dollars. Grenville
thought this form
of taxation would
afford no chance to
evade the custom-house,
no temptation
to smuggle,
and would dispense
with all disagreeable
prying into
warehouses and private
dwellings in
search of smuggled goods. It was believed that the act would
enforce itself and produce a large revenue.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s126'></a><span class='bold'>126. Spirit of the Colonies.</span>—This belief shows how generally
the spirit of the colonists was misunderstood. Only a few
of the greatest and wisest of the British statesmen saw the
danger in the policy proposed. These men, of whom Chatham
and Burke were the leaders, did not deny the constitutional
right of Parliament to tax all British subjects, but they held
that it would be madness to try to enforce that right, since
such an attempt would probably result in the loss of the colonies.
The very thing they feared and predicted took place.</p>

<h3 id='s127a'>THE RESISTANCE OF THE COLONISTS.</h3>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s127'></a><span class='bold'>127. Organization for Resistance.</span>—The colonists instantly
organized a general resistance to the tax. Samuel Adams<a id='r59'/><a href='#f59' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[59]</span></sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
James Otis<a id='r60'/><a href='#f60' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[60]</span></sup></a> in Massachusetts, and Patrick Henry<a id='r61'/><a href='#f61' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[61]</span></sup></a> in Virginia,
were the most active of the colonial leaders. Adams sent letters
in every direction
denouncing the
tax; Otis inflamed the
people of Boston and
the vicinity with his
essays and his oratory;
and Henry
appealed to the Virginians
with overpowering
eloquence. A general
congress representing
the colonies met in
New York, October 7,
1765, and passed a
series of resolutions
denouncing the Stamp
Act as a violent encroachment
on the
principle, “No taxation
without representation.”
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
Lawyers agreed not to regard paper as made
illegal by the absence of a stamp. Newspapers were issued
bearing the sign of a
skull and crossbones
in place of a stamp,
and boxes of stamps,
on their arrival, were
seized and burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s128'></a><span class='bold'>128. Repeal of the
Stamp Act.</span>—It was
not long before even
Grenville was convinced
that the Stamp
Act was a failure. As
it could not be enforced,
and as it
brought very little
revenue, it was repealed
the very year
after it had become a
law. There are, however,
two ways of doing
an act demanded
by the people: to do it with a tact that will convey the largest
amount of satisfaction; or to do it with some reservation or
qualification that leaves a sting behind it. The latter course
was taken by the British government, which said in substance:
We repeal the act, because its enforcement will be injurious to
our commercial interests, but in doing so we expressly declare
“the supreme right of Parliament to make laws and statutes
of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and the
people of America in all ways whatever.”

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s129'></a><span class='bold'>129. The Townshend Acts.</span>—The “Stamp Act” was followed
by the “Townshend Acts” in 1767. One of these acts forbade
the colonies to trade
with the West Indies
and was evidently
designed to force the
Americans to buy
West Indian goods in
Great Britain. Another
provided for a
new duty on all imports
of glass, paper,
paints, and teas. Still
another, and the most
obnoxious of the
Townshend Acts, was
one which legalized
“Writs of Assistance.”
Such writs
had formerly been
unlawfully used as a means of enforcing the statute against
smuggling. These papers, by being signed in blank, so that
names could be inserted at the convenience of the officer, provided
a means by which any sheriff or constable could enter any
man’s house to search for whatever he wanted to find.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s130'></a><span class='bold'>130. Opposition to the Townshend Acts.</span>—The Townshend
Acts provoked instant opposition. Associations pledged to abstain
from using any of the articles taxed, were formed in various
parts of the country. The Massachusetts Assembly sent a
circular letter to the other colonies, inviting them to concerted
resistance; but this letter so provoked the king that he ordered
the governor of Massachusetts to demand that the Assembly rescind
the vote, on pain of dissolution. The Assembly promptly
refused, whereupon Governor Bernard promptly dissolved it.
Everywhere a similar spirit of opposition prevailed.

there was a spirited
quarrel between some
citizens and the soldiers
in one of the streets of
Boston, whereupon the
troops fired upon the
crowd, killing five and
wounding seven others.
This event, commonly
known as the “Boston
Massacre,” greatly widened
the breach. An
immense concourse gathered
the next day in the
Old South Meetinghouse.
Samuel Adams was sent
to Governor Hutchinson<a id='r64'/><a href='#f64' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[64]</span></sup></a> to demand, in the name of three thousand
freemen, the removal of the soldiers from the town. The
governor thought it prudent not to refuse, and sent the troops
to an island in Boston Harbor.</p>

<h3 id='s133a'>THE TAX ON TEA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s133'></a><span class='bold'>133. Partial Repeal of the Townshend Acts.</span>—These events
convinced Parliament that the Townshend Acts could not
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
be enforced; but the government only repeated the course
taken in repealing the Stamp Act. Instead of annulling the
obnoxious provisions outright,
they repealed the tax
on all the articles except
tea, but they held to the
duty on this one article in
order to maintain the principle.
They ingeniously
tried to make the tax on
tea acceptable by remitting
the usual duty which had
to be paid on tea sent to
America, when in transit
it arrived in England. But
it was not the cost of the
tea that the Americans
objected to; it was the
principle of taxation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s134'></a><span class='bold'>134. General Treatment
of the Tea.</span>—As the British
had no doubt the
Americans would receive
the tea under these conditions,
large cargoes were
sent to various American
ports. The government
commissioners appointed
to receive this tea soon
found that the people
everywhere refused it. In Charleston large quantities were
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
stored and afterward sold to the public; at Annapolis the tea
was burned; at Philadelphia and at New York, after browbeating
the commissioner into resigning, the people compelled
the ships to return to England.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s135'></a><span class='bold'>135. The Boston “Tea Party.”</span>—It was in Boston, however,
that the most vigorous action was taken. A large cargo had
arrived in December of 1773, but the people would not allow
it to be landed. The vessel no doubt would have returned to
England, but the colonial officers refused to give the clearance
papers required of all vessels before sailing. If the cargo was
not landed within twenty days after its arrival, the custom-house
officers were authorized by law to seize and land it by
force. It was evident that the tea must be destroyed, or its
landing could not be prevented except by open resistance. On
the nineteenth day a town meeting of six or seven thousand
persons met in and about the Old South Meetinghouse to
decide what course to pursue. During the evening, in accordance
with a general understanding, a great crowd went down
to the wharf to see what would occur. When they were
assembled, a small company of men, dressed as Indians,
quietly rowed out to the ships, broke open more than three
hundred chests of tea, and poured the contents into the harbor.</p>

<h3 id='s136a'>NEW LEGISLATION AND OPPOSITION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s136'></a><span class='bold'>136. The “Five Acts of 1774.”</span>—This defiant action, though
applauded in all parts of the colonies, filled the British government
with indignation, and drove the ministers to the “Five
Acts of 1774,” which by their unwise energy immediately precipitated
the crisis. Four of these were directed against
Massachusetts alone; the fifth affected all the colonies. The
first of the five acts was the “Boston Port Bill.” It provided
that no ships should be allowed to enter or depart from Boston
Harbor until the tea that had been destroyed was paid for.
This in effect put an end to the commerce of the city, and completely
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
destroyed its prosperity. Gloucester was made the
port of entry and Salem the seat of government. The second
act was that for the “Impartial Administration of Justice in
Massachusetts Bay,” which reflected upon the colony’s tribunals
by providing for the trial in England or Nova Scotia of
officials accused of murder committed in the discharge of
their functions. The third was the “Massachusetts Bill,”
which virtually took away the charter by vesting all power of
appointment and removal exclusively in the governor appointed
by the Crown. The fourth was an act which provided for the
quartering of troops on the people, thus establishing the means
of enforcing new laws. The fifth was the “Quebec Act,” of
which the most offensive feature was the one providing that
all the British territory west of the Alleghanies and north of
the Ohio should henceforth be regarded as a part of Canada.
As this territory was claimed by the colonies, the act was
regarded as a gross infringement of their rights. The Quebec
Act also gave the Roman Catholic religion throughout Canada
the stamp of official recognition.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s137'></a><span class='bold'>137. Opposition in Parliament.</span>—The passage of these acts
was strenuously opposed by several of the strongest men in
Parliament. The opposition of Fox, Burke, Pitt, and Barré
was particularly energetic. In the House of Peers, Lord
Rockingham and his friends entered a protest on the journal
of the House, and the Duke of Richmond declared, in his
indignation, “I wish from the bottom of my heart that the
Americans may resist and get the better of the forces sent
against them.” But the king was determined, and Lord North,
who had just been advanced to the position of prime minister,
gave his general assent to the measures, though he
privately tried to prevent the king from pressing the Transportation
Bill.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s138'></a><span class='bold'>138. Effect upon the Colonies.</span>—Upon the colonies the effect
of these acts was general and immediate. As soon as the provisions
of the Boston Port Bill became known, the colonies
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
all saw that they must act together or be individually crushed.
Public opinion rapidly took definite form. This was largely
the work of committees
of correspondence,
organized at Faneuil
Hall, Boston, chiefly
through the energy
and foresight of Samuel
Adams. In Virginia
a similar mode of
procedure was adopted
the following year, and
an invitation was extended
to all the colonies to appoint committees for the same
purpose. The work of these committees was to make each
colony acquainted with the views of all the others.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s139'></a><span class='bold'>139. First Continental Congress.</span>—As a result of the agitation
that followed, Massachusetts, at the request of New York,
called for a meeting of representatives of the various colonies,
to be convened early in September, 1774. The governor of
Georgia prohibited the appointment
of delegates, but representatives of
the twelve other colonies met on the
5th of September, in Carpenters’
Hall, in Philadelphia. This body is
known as the “First Continental
Congress.” It contained a large
share of the ablest men in the country.
After adopting a Declaration
of Colonial Rights, in which the
political claims of the colonies were
clearly and fully set forth, they
named eleven different acts, which
they declared had been passed in violation of their rights
since the accession of George III. They framed a petition
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
to the king, as well as an address to the people of Great
Britain, and then formed what was called “The American
Association,” the object of which was to put a stop to all trade
with Great Britain until the obnoxious laws should be repealed.
After providing for another congress, to be held in the following
spring, the meeting adjourned on the 26th of October.</p>

<h3 id='s140a'>THE CRISIS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s140'></a><span class='bold'>140. General Gage and the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts.</span>—While
these actions were taking place in Philadelphia,
affairs were drifting to an immediate crisis in Massachusetts.
General Gage, now governor of Massachusetts, as well as military
commander, was fully inspired with the spirit of his royal
master. He promptly sent to Chelsea for military stores and
began a system of fortifications. The colonists, easily perceiving
the significance of the British general’s action, took similar
measures of precaution. In order to be independent of General
Gage, they also organized what is known as “The Provincial
Congress of Massachusetts”; and this body, on the very
day when the First Continental Congress adjourned, authorized
the organization of a military force, consisting of all the able-bodied
men in the colony. One fourth of these were to be
always ready for action, and, hence, were known as minutemen.
After making provisions for supplying the army with
the necessary equipment and munitions, the Provincial Congress
intrusted the conduct of affairs to the general control of
a Committee of Safety, of which John Hancock,<a id='r66'/><a href='#f66' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[66]</span></sup></a> a wealthy
merchant of Boston, was the chairman.
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s141'></a><span class='bold'>141. Gage’s Purpose.</span>—It was not long before blood was
shed. There were certain military stores at Concord, and
General Gage determined to seize them. For this purpose
he dispatched very secretly about eight hundred men, under
Lieutenant Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn. The expedition
had still another object. The king having ordered the arrest
of John Hancock and Samuel Adams, these leaders had
withdrawn from Boston and were the guests of a friend in
Lexington. Gage had learned where they were and had ordered
their seizure by the troops bound for Concord. The British
force, after taking the greatest precautions for secrecy, left the
city on the night of the 18th of April. But the vigilant eye of a
patriot, Dr. Warren, had detected the purpose of the movement.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s142'></a><span class='bold'>142. The Ride of Paul Revere.</span>—In spite of Gage’s orders
that nobody should leave Boston that night, Paul Revere, a
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
Boston goldsmith, succeeded in crossing the Charles River,—having
previously attended to setting an alarm signal in the tower
of the Old North Church,—and galloped by the Medford road
toward Lexington, shouting at every house that the British
were coming.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s143'></a><span class='bold'>143. Battles of Lexington and Concord.</span>—The minutemen
instantly assembled and drew up on Lexington Common to
meet the British when they
appeared. Pitcairn ordered
them to disperse, but seeing
no signs of their moving, first
fired his own pistols and then
ordered a volley. Eight men
were killed and ten wounded.
Although the Americans fired
in return, they were in no
condition to offer battle.
Hancock and Adams, having
received the necessary warning,
made timely escape. The
troops pushed on to Concord,
but found that the greater part
of the stores had been removed.
Four hundred Americans
then charged across the
Concord bridge and drove
back the British. The minutemen
were by this time
streaming in from every direction,
and as the British were
fired upon from behind trees
and fences, they had nothing
to do but to beat a retreat. They were saved only by a
timely reënforcement of twelve hundred men under Lord Percy.
In the course of the expedition the British lost two hundred
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
and seventy-three; the Americans, eighty-eight. The battles of
Lexington and Concord, April 19, 1775, proclaimed to everybody
that war had begun. The readiness with which the people
responded to the call was shown by the fact that among the
killed and wounded on that day there were representatives of
twenty-three different towns. Within less than a week General
Gage found himself surrounded in Boston by a motley force
of sixteen thousand Americans armed with such weapons as
they could secure.</p>

The governor of South Carolina wrote, “The frame of the civil government

The governor of New Jersey wrote of the legislature that he “could not

rebellion.” The governor of Massachusetts wrote deploring “the mobbish

<h3 id='s144a'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>EARLY MOVEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s144'></a><span class='bold'>144. Continental Army and Commander in Chief.</span>—When the
Second Continental Congress came together in the spring of
1775, one of its first acts was to adopt as a continental army
the forces which had enlisted in Massachusetts. It then performed
an act of the greatest possible service to the cause by
appointing George Washington<a id='r67'/><a href='#f67' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[67]</span></sup></a> commander in chief. Washington
was forty-three years of age, and the important services
he had rendered in Virginia and Pennsylvania (§§ <a href='#s106'>106</a>-<a href='#s111'>111</a>)
had given him such military knowledge and such accuracy of
judgment in dealing with men as made him universally respected
and admired. He accepted the appointment with a
full sense of the greatness of the task, and declared that he
would receive no pay, but would rely on Congress to reimburse
him for his expenses.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s145'></a><span class='bold'>145. Capture of Ticonderoga.</span>—While Congress was taking
these preliminary steps, there was great activity in various
parts of the country. Ethan Allen and Seth Warner, with a
small force from Vermont, assisted by a few men from Connecticut
under Benedict Arnold, surprised and captured Fort
Ticonderoga. By this success the Americans got possession
of an important fort, as well as of many stores and more than
two hundred cannon.

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s146'></a><span class='bold'>146. Fortification of Bunker Hill.</span>—As soon as the news of
Lexington and Concord spread through the colonies, troops
poured in to the vicinity of Boston from Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, and Pennsylvania. Before the middle of
June, Boston, on the land side, was thoroughly invested. The
British had seventeen battalions of infantry and five companies
of artillery, and before June their army was joined by three
major generals—Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne. Late in the
afternoon of June 16, General Ward, then in command of the
Americans, ordered a force to take possession of Bunker Hill, a
commanding point in Charlestown, just north of Boston. About
twelve hundred troops under Colonel Prescott, a veteran of the
French War, went over from Cambridge with spades and picks,
which in the course of the night they used so industriously that
the British soldiers in the morning saw strong works confronting
them. But instead of obeying orders and occupying Bunker
Hill, Prescott occupied Breed’s Hill, a point nearer Boston.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s147'></a><span class='bold'>147. The Battle of Bunker Hill.</span>—General Gage, wishing to
dislodge the Americans at once, instead of approaching by the
Neck (see <a href='#m6'>map</a>), where he could have cut off the whole
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
force, ordered an immediate assault upon the enemy’s front.
Meanwhile, in the course of the forenoon (June 17), the Americans
were reënforced by about one thousand troops. These
newcomers, however, had little ammunition and few bayonets.
The British, numbering about three thousand, advanced under
the gallant lead of General
Howe. The Americans reserved
their fire until the
front ranks were within
about fifty yards, when at
the first volley so many of
the assaulting force fell
that the line staggered back
in confusion. The second
advance met with a still
more disastrous repulse. In
several of the companies as
many as four out of five had
fallen; but when the third
assault was made, the ammunition
of the Americans
gave out, and the British
were successful. Among the
killed were many officers of rank, including Pitcairn, the British
commander who had fired the first shot at Lexington, and
General Warren,<a id='r68'/><a href='#f68' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[68]</span></sup></a> one of the foremost of the American leaders.
The British lost one thousand and fifty-four in killed and
wounded; the Americans, four hundred and forty-nine. The
forces were relatively small, but, in proportion to the numbers on
the field, the battle was one of the bloodiest engagements of modern
times. On both sides the men fought with a bravery worthy
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
of the best traditions of English courage. Of Howe’s twelve
staff officers every one was either killed or wounded. The battle
made it evident
that untrained American
recruits, when
behind only temporary
defenses, had no
need to be afraid to
meet disciplined veterans.
The British
government, dissatisfied
with the conduct
of General Gage,
recalled him and
he was superseded
by General William
Howe.<a id='r69'/><a href='#f69' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[69]</span></sup></a></p>

<h3 id='s148a'>WASHINGTON IN COMMAND.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s148'></a><span class='bold'>148. Difficulties confronting Washington.</span>—Washington soon
reached the scene of action, and took command of the American
army on July 3, under an elm tree which still stands near Harvard
University, in Cambridge, commemorating the event. The
difficulties which beset him might well have disheartened a less
resolute and skillful commander. His embarrassments were
chiefly of three kinds. In the first place, the number of men
at his command was at no time greater than the number of the
regular British troops confronting him. His force had left
their farms in midsummer without having enlisted for any
definite period, and when the first burst of enthusiasm died
away, it was very difficult to keep the ranks filled. In the
second place, each of the provinces had its own laws, and
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
consequently there was no uniformity of method and no subordination
to any common authority. Washington dismissed
sundry officers for insubordination, and he was obliged persistently
to urge the governors of the several states to keep
their quotas full.<a id='r70'/><a href='#f70' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[70]</span></sup></a> In the third place, he soon discovered that
the Americans had very little ammunition. There was not
enough for a single battle, and it was plain that if at any time
during the fall or winter the British should make a vigorous
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
attack, they would in all probability succeed in breaking up
the American army. To supply this deficiency Washington
sent messengers in every direction. He dispatched an expedition
to seize the British stores at the Bermudas; he had cannon
dragged on ox sleds from Ticonderoga; and he gradually collected
powder from all the country towns in the region.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s149'></a><span class='bold'>149. The Taking of Dorchester Heights.</span>—Notwithstanding all
these discouragements, Washington drilled the army vigorously
throughout the fall and winter. Early in March, 1776, he
determined upon a movement
which was destined
to prove decisive. Dorchester
Heights, projecting
from the mainland south
of Boston, commanded
the town from this direction,
as Charlestown commanded
it from the north.
Howe committed a fatal
blunder in not establishing
himself upon this point;
and the consequence was,
that one morning he discovered
that the enterprising enemy had not only occupied the
hill, but had thrown up formidable works commanding the city.
A few days later, on March 9, the Americans also constructed
works on Nook’s Point, which commanded the Neck and brought
every part of the city within range.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s150'></a><span class='bold'>150. Evacuation of Boston.</span>—Howe, not caring to repeat the
experiences of Bunker Hill, saw that he must evacuate the city.
With all his troops he withdrew and sailed for Halifax,
March 17, 1776, leaving the Americans in full possession. His
force of veterans had been besieged for months by an army of raw
troops, which did not at any time exceed in number the army of
the besieged. More remarkable still, the besieging army had,
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
during this period, been disbanded and reorganized, and during
most of the winter had not had ammunition amounting to more
than thirty rounds to a
man. This great achievement
not only inspired the
colonies, but convinced the
British government that
it had undertaken a most
formidable task. Washington,
without a battle,
had, by his superior strategy,
maneuvered his enemy
out of the city.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Colonel Benedict Arnold.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s151'></a><span class='bold'>151. Expedition into
Canada.</span>—While the siege
of Boston was going on,
Colonel Benedict Arnold<a id='r71'/><a href='#f71' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[71]</span></sup></a>
suggested that an expedition
should be sent for the
capture of Montreal and
Quebec. Unfortunately, this unwise proposition prevailed. A
part of the force under General Montgomery descended Lake
Champlain and, after a difficult, brilliant campaign, took
Montreal. The other command, under Arnold, after an expedition
of almost indescribable hardships through the forests of
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
Maine in the dead of winter, presented itself before Quebec.
Montgomery, who had by that time advanced from Montreal,
attacked the city from above while Arnold attacked it from
below. Montgomery was killed while scaling the heights, and
Arnold was severely wounded. Morgan, Arnold’s second in
command, pressed forward and would, no doubt, have been
successful, if Montgomery’s force had not been thrown into
panic by the fall of their leader. Morgan and nearly all his
force were taken prisoners, and the expedition was a complete
failure.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s152'></a><span class='bold'>152. Final Effort of Congress for Peace.</span>—In the course of
the same winter (1775–1776), Congress, then in session at Philadelphia,
put forth another and a final effort to make terms with
the king. A careful and formal statement of grievances was
sent to England, but neither the king nor Parliament would
receive it, determining instead very greatly to increase the
army. This was done, partly by sending additional British
troops, and partly by hiring about twenty thousand Germans
from some of the lesser German princes. As these mercenaries
came very largely from the duchy of Hesse, they were known
throughout the war as Hessians. The fact that the British
bought the services of foreigners to fight the Americans greatly
exasperated the colonists.</p>

<h3 id='s153a'>THE WAR IN NEW YORK.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s153'></a><span class='bold'>153. Washington’s Movements.</span>—After the failure of the
Canadian expedition, Washington conjectured that the British
would try to get possession of the Hudson by attacking it both
from the north and from the south. He had no doubt that
Howe’s force would ultimately land at New York. To meet
such a movement, he ordered Arnold, as soon as he should recover
from his wound, to oppose any approach from the north,
while he himself should transfer the greater part of his army
to New York. Arriving in April, 1776, he soon found that
his conjecture had been correct. Howe, as soon as he had
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
reorganized his forces in Halifax, set sail for the mouth of the
Hudson. Here he established headquarters upon Staten
Island, where he received reënforcements till he had an
army of about thirty
thousand men. He
soon had the assistance
also of a formidable
fleet under
Admiral Lord Howe,
his brother.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Nathanael Greene.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s154'></a><span class='bold'>154. Occupation of
New York and Brooklyn.</span>—Washington
had not only taken
possession of New
York City, but had
fortified Governor’s
Island, as well as
Brooklyn, and the
New Jersey shore at
Paulus Hook opposite
New York. Brooklyn
Heights were put in
command of General Nathanael Greene,<a id='r72'/><a href='#f72' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[72]</span></sup></a> but he was suddenly
stricken with fever and the command was transferred to
General Israel Putnam,<a id='r73'/><a href='#f73' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[73]</span></sup></a> with Generals Sullivan and Stirling
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
as subordinate officers, and a force of about nine thousand
men.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s155'></a><span class='bold'>155. Battle of Long Island.</span>—As this position commanded
the city, the British took the natural course of planning an
attack from the east. Landing southeast of Brooklyn with
about twenty thousand men, August 22 and 25, Howe pushed
one of his divisions by a circuitous route toward the north, for
the purpose of turning the flank of the Americans and making
their escape in that direction impossible. In the battle of
Long Island, which ensued, the Americans, having only about
five thousand men in the field, were greatly outnumbered
and defeated. Generals Sullivan and Stirling, with about two
thousand of their men, were taken prisoners. The remainder
of the army fell back and rejoined Putnam within the fortifications.
Preparations were at once made for a siege. With the
British force surrounding Brooklyn on the land side and with
Admiral Howe’s fleet in New York Bay, the escape of the
army, which Washington had now reënforced to about twelve
thousand men, seemed impossible.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s156'></a><span class='bold'>156. Retreat to New York.</span>—Washington well knew that the
Brooklyn army must either escape or surrender. He therefore
caused all the boats and rafts of every kind that could
transport men or ammunition, to be brought together from the
various streams and bays in the vicinity. So skillfully was
this work done, that in the course of a single foggy night,
August 29, the boats were collected on the Brooklyn side of
the river, and the whole army, with guns and stores, was taken
across to New York. This remarkable exploit might, no doubt,
have been prevented had there been greater vigilance on the
part of the British fleet.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s157'></a><span class='bold'>157. Evacuation of New York.</span>—But this bit of good fortune
did not enable Washington to hold New York. The British
immediately sailed up the East River and prepared to land
their forces, if possible, so as to intercept Washington’s army.
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
They secured a footing, September 15, first at Kipp’s Bay,
where the Thirty-fourth Street ferry now is, and later at
Throg’s Neck, a few miles above; but the main force of the
Americans was able to pass up the west coast of the island
before the enemy could cut them off.<a id='r74'/><a href='#f74' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[74]</span></sup></a> Washington’s troops
were not numerous enough to justify a pitched battle; but
while retreating, he retarded and annoyed the enemy at every
point. On the 28th of October he fought a slight engagement
at White Plains, some thirty miles from New York,
to hold the British in check while the main army should pass
still farther north. The British now withdrew to Dobb’s Ferry
and threatened Fort Washington.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s158'></a><span class='bold'>158. Loss of Fort Washington and Fort Lee.</span>—The lower
Hudson at that time depended for its defense upon two fortifications:
Fort Washington, situated near the upper end of
Manhattan Island, on which the city of New York stands, and
Fort Lee, on the opposite side of the river. Washington decided
to abandon these defenses to the British and to establish
strong fortifications some forty-five miles up the river. Congress,
however, directed that Fort Washington be held, if
possible; and the commander unfortunately yielded his opinion
so far as to allow General Greene, who was in command of
both the forts, to defend them in case he should deem successful
defense possible. The result was the most serious of the
early disasters of the war. The British broke through the
obstructions that had been placed in the river, and having
passed with their fleet above Fort Washington, surrounded it
in such a way that escape was impossible. When a vigorous
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
assault was made, nearly three thousand American troops were
forced to surrender, November 16. The abandonment of Fort
Lee necessarily followed.</p>

<h3 id='s159a'>GENERAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.</h3>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/i118.jpg' alt='' id='i118' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Colonial Flag, 1776.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s159'></a><span class='bold'>159. Lack of Union among the Colonies.</span>—The war was not
simply a war of separation; it was also in some of its features
a civil war. The loss of New York, including Fort Washington,
brought out the American opponents of the Revolution in
great force. From the very beginning of the agitation which
resulted in independence, there had been three somewhat distinct
classes of people among the colonists. One class believed
that on the whole the British
government was the best in existence,
and that the colonists
would be benefited by showing
a constant spirit of loyalty and
fidelity to the Crown. Such
people were opposed to every
form of agitation that would
look to the British like insubordination.
The second class, while
believing that there were abuses
which should and would be corrected, acknowledged the supreme
power of Parliament. Like the British, they did not
see why their lack of representation differed very greatly in
principle from the condition of some of the larger towns in
England. They thought also that the abuses could in time
be removed by a general and friendly agitation. The third
class consisted of the out-and-out reformers. Their leaders
were such men as Samuel Adams, James Otis, and Patrick
Henry, who believed that if the rights of the colonies were
not granted when they were pointed out, the proper course
was to fight for them. As the agitation went on and the
British government made blunder after blunder, the third of
these classes, though at first inferior in numbers to the others,
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
became more perfectly organized and so got the upper hand.
But it is a great mistake to suppose that the American people
at any time were unanimous on the subject of independence,
or even of resistance. It is probable that in the second year
of the war, even in New England, one fourth of the people
were opposed to it; that in the Middle states the proportion
was as great as one-third; and in the Southern states nearly,
or quite, as great as one half.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s160'></a><span class='bold'>160. The Tories.</span>—All those who were opposed to the action
of Congress naturally came to be regarded as enemies, and were
known as Tories. From the first they made a vast amount of
trouble. During the siege of Boston they were numerous,
outspoken, and influential. They desired that the Revolutionary
cause should fail. They acted as spies and carried information
to the British; and whenever the patriot cause suffered
any check or disaster, they did whatever they could to show
that successful resistance was impossible. In the State of
New York the Tories from the first were not only numerous,
but very active. Soon after Washington took possession of
the city he discovered that Tryon, the Tory governor, was at
the bottom of a plot to capture or kill the commander in
chief, and turn over the city to the enemy. Tryon escaped,
but some of the other leaders were arrested and tried, and one
of Washington’s own guards, who had been bribed, was publicly
hanged. Though this summary procedure discouraged
the Tories, they continued to be of great service to the British
and of great annoyance to the Americans. In New York and
in the South the struggle was attended with many of the
horrors of civil war.</p>

<h3 id='s161a'>FAILURE OF BRITISH EXPEDITIONS.</h3>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s161'></a><span class='bold'>161. Carleton’s Expedition.</span>—While Washington had been
unsuccessfully attempting to resist the advances of the British
in New York, the Americans had been more fortunate in other
parts of the country. An expedition under Sir Guy Carleton,
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
the governor of Canada, was planned to advance up the river
St. John, into Lake Champlain, and down the Hudson, but
it met so vigorous a resistance from Arnold near Valcour’s
Island, that, although Arnold’s fleet was almost destroyed,
the British were obliged to return to Montreal for winter
quarters.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s162'></a><span class='bold'>162. Expedition of Sir Henry Clinton.</span>—In the South the
enemy fared no better. Sir Henry Clinton, with about two
thousand men, had
been sent from Boston,
while the siege
was going on, to take
possession of North
Carolina; but the
sturdy Scotchmen of
that state, who were
generally Tories, were
defeated by the patriots,
who immediately
organized so
powerful a resistance
that Clinton did not
attempt even to land.
Reënforced a little
later by a British fleet
of ten ships under Sir
Peter Parker, he advanced
upon Charleston
in South Carolina.
Vigorous preparations for resistance had already been made,
under the direction of General Lee. General William Moultrie<a id='r75'/><a href='#f75' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[75]</span></sup></a>
constructed a low fort in Charleston Harbor, chiefly of
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
palmetto logs and sand, which proved an effectual barrier to
the British advance. The shots from the fleet sank into the
spongy logs without doing much damage, while the shots from
the fort were so effective as to disable nine of the ten ships
(June 28). The gallantry of this defense has caused the fort
ever since to be known as Fort Moultrie, although events of
the War between the States have caused the neighboring Fort
Sumter to become more famous. Clinton’s land force being
held back for lack of suitable boats, the expedition proved
a complete failure, and the British with their disabled ships
returned to the North.</p>

<h3 id='s163a'>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</h3>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s163'></a><span class='bold'>163. Growing Spirit of Independence.</span>—Of much greater importance
than the events in the field were the events in Congress.
At the beginning of the contest public opinion in
America very generally attributed the course of Great Britain
to bad leaders in Parliament rather than to the king. At first
there was a strong feeling of loyalty and even affection toward
George III., which would have made it easy for him to heal all
differences. One effort after another had been made to induce
the king to consider the petitions and remonstrances sent him,
but these efforts had all failed. Even as late as the beginning
of the war there was very little general thought of independence.
But at the end of May, soon after the news of the first
conflict at Lexington and Concord reached North Carolina, the
people of Mecklenburg County assembled and passed a series
of resolutions, declaring that as the mother country had pronounced
the Americans rebels, the colonists were absolved from
all further allegiance. This declaration seems to have attracted
very little attention at the time; but as events progressed, public
opinion drifted so rapidly in this direction, that early in the
summer of 1776 the leading minds came one after another to
the conclusion that independence was inevitable. Final action
was not the result of any sudden impulse, but of most careful
consideration.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s164'></a><span class='bold'>164. Signing of the Declaration.</span>—After much private discussion
had revealed the opinions of the members of Congress,
Richard Henry Lee,<a id='r76'/><a href='#f76' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[76]</span></sup></a> on the 7th of June, offered a resolution
that “these united colonies are and ought to be independent
states, and they are absolved
from all allegiance to the
British crown.” The resolution
was vigorously opposed
by Dickinson of Pennsylvania
and Livingston of
New York, partly on the
ground that a sufficient time
had not yet elapsed for an
answer from the king, and
partly because the individual
colonies had not yet
authorized such action. But
the colonies did not long
hesitate. Most of them had
already erected independent
governments of their own.
As early as July, 1775, Massachusetts had formed a government
in which the king’s authority was practically set aside,
and James Bowdoin was made chief executive officer and John
Adams chief justice. Before July, 1776, all the other provinces,
with the exception of New York, had taken similar measures,
and more than two-thirds of them had voted for independence
and had instructed their delegates to vote for Lee’s resolution.
This resolution was accordingly adopted by Congress on the
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
2d of July. A committee, with Thomas Jefferson<a id='r77'/><a href='#f77' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[77]</span></sup></a> as chairman,
had been appointed in June to draw up a formal declaration
in case independence should be agreed upon. Jefferson,
then only thirty-three
years of
age, wrote the
paper which, after
slight modifications
by Franklin
and Adams,
was adopted as
the Declaration
of Independence,
on the 4th of
July, 1776. This
immortal document
was thus
put forth as an
expression of the
deliberate and
firm conviction
of the American
people that the
priceless treasure
of human liberty
could be preserved in no other manner. As the members
one after another, with a solemn sense of the danger of
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
this momentous act, signed the memorable document, Franklin<a id='r78'/><a href='#f78' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[78]</span></sup></a>
threw a gleam
of sunshine upon the
occasion by remarking
that they must now
all hang together, or
they would hang separately.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s165'></a><span class='bold'>165. Purport and
Effect of the Declaration.</span>—The
Declaration
of Independence was
aimed directly at the
Crown. It charged the
king with “repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States.”
This general indictment
was sustained,
with some exaggerations
but with essential
truthfulness, by
no less than eighteen
accusations, or separate
counts, aimed at
the king, and the king
alone. So far as the
purpose of the colonies
was defined by the
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
Declaration, it was not a contest against the parliamentary
government of Great Britain, but a contest against those unconstitutional
usurpations of the Crown to which the colonies
would not submit. From this point of view many modern
criticisms of the document are seen to be hypercritical. However
much the signers may have exaggerated specific charges,
they did not exaggerate the general danger to be apprehended
from the king’s self-willed conduct.</p>

<h3 id='s166a'>THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s166'></a><span class='bold'>166. Washington’s First Campaign in New Jersey.</span>—After the
fall of Fort Washington and the withdrawal from Fort Lee,
Washington planned to concentrate the main portion of his
army in New Jersey, to prevent the enemy from advancing
upon Philadelphia. In crossing to New Jersey he had left
General Charles Lee, with seven thousand men, at Northcastle
on the east side of the Hudson. Washington now directed
General Heath to fortify the Highlands about Peekskill and
West Point in the strongest manner possible, and ordered
General Lee to join the main army in New Jersey.
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s167'></a><span class='bold'>167. Disobedience and Capture of Lee.</span>—For reasons which
were long unexplained, Lee disobeyed the order of Washington,
and chose to remain where he was. Repeated orders were
disobeyed, but finally Lee made a show of obedience. He
reached Morristown, however, with only three thousand of his
seven thousand troops. Scarcely had he posted this fragment
of his army on the Morristown Heights when, leaving the immediate
command to Sullivan, he took quarters in a small
public house some miles away. A Tory, learning of this fact,
galloped eighteen miles with the news to the British, and
the consequence was that Lee, in dressing gown and slippers,
was taken prisoner by a troop of British dragoons. From
Lee’s subsequent career (§§ <a href='#s183'>183</a>, <a href='#s184'>184</a>) and the discovery of his
correspondence, it now seems probable that he already had
traitorous designs.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s168'></a><span class='bold'>168. Washington’s Difficulties and his Retreat.</span>—The capture
of Lee left Sullivan in command of the Northern army, and that
officer moved at once to the support of Washington; but the
difficulties of the situation seemed overwhelming. Howe and
Cornwallis had crossed into New Jersey with a force more than
twice as great as that of the Americans. Moreover, as the
terms of enlistment expired, Washington found it almost impossible
to keep his ranks full. Still worse, Howe, desiring to
take advantage of the apparent lack of enthusiasm on the part
of the American patriots, now made a final effort to induce
them to throw down their arms. This was done under a promise
of full pardon and protection to all who should abandon the
Continental cause. More than three thousand persons, believing
there was no possibility of success for the Americans,
yielded to these allurements and deserted to the British. Tories
everywhere now emerged from their obscurity and boldly
asserted their allegiance to the king. Washington could not
venture battle with his inferior force, but, with masterly skill,
he slowly withdrew his army, crossing stream after stream
with the British close on his heels. Even the broad waters of
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
the Delaware did not baffle him. Pressed hard by superior
forces, he threw his army across the river and destroyed all the
boats on the opposite bank for nearly one hundred miles. His
opponents found it impossible to
follow, and decided to wait for
the river to freeze over.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s169'></a><span class='bold'>169. Washington turns upon
his Enemy.</span>—Howe and Cornwallis
thought the war practically
at an end. Deciding to leave
their army east of the Delaware, with its center at Trenton and
its wings at Burlington and Princeton, they returned to New
York for the festivities of the holidays, where Howe was to
celebrate the knighthood conferred upon him for the capture
of New York. But Washington had a Christmas surprise in
store for them. Including the forces of Gates and Sullivan,
he now commanded about six thousand men. The loose disposition
of Howe’s troops gave him an opportunity which he
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
immediately turned to account. He decided by a secret movement
to strike a hard blow at the British center. His plan was
to cross the Delaware in three divisions. The right wing,
under Gates and Cadwalader, was to attack the Hessians
under Donop at Burlington; Ewing was to cross and attack the
center at Trenton; while Washington himself, with the left
wing six miles up the river, was to cross at that point and
march down on the other side to attack the British flank and
rear. Gates had asked and been allowed to go to Philadelphia,
where he was already intriguing with Congress in order to supplant
Washington. The right wing and the center found the
river, filled as it was with floating ice, too difficult to cross, but
Washington’s determination and skill at once showed themselves.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s170'></a><span class='bold'>170. Battle of Trenton.</span>—Just as he was ready for the advance,
news came that his right and center had failed, and yet,
without a moment’s hesitation, he decided himself to push on
with all the greater energy.<a id='r79'/><a href='#f79' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[79]</span></sup></a> Blocks of floating ice made the
crossing next to impossible. Colonel Glover, with a force of
Marblehead fishermen, was put in charge of the boats. In the
course of ten hours he succeeded in taking twenty-five hundred
men across with their guns and munitions. They now had six
miles to march in a blinding storm. After a night so cold that
two men of their number were frozen to death, they reached
Trenton at daybreak. Planting their guns so as to rake the
streets, they made escape impossible. Colonel Rahl, of the
enemy, and seventeen of his men were killed; the others surrendered
(December 26). Donop, fearing to be cut off by the
advance of Washington, fell back to Princeton. Washington
recrossed the river with his prisoners, but on the 29th took up
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
his position once more at Trenton. Thus the center of the
British army was destroyed.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s171'></a><span class='bold'>171. Advance of Cornwallis.</span>—Howe and Cornwallis, so
rudely disturbed in the midst of their Christmas festivities,
saw in a moment that a blow must be struck to recover the lost
ground. With a force of about eight thousand men, Cornwallis
advanced by way of New Brunswick and Princeton, where he
established magazines and supplies, with a strong force to guard
them. The army, harassed along every mile of the way by
sharpshooters, reached Trenton on the 2d of January. Meanwhile
Washington had moved in a southern direction, and taken
up his position on the left bank of the Assanpink, a small
stream flowing into the Delaware on the north side, not far
south of Trenton. The crossings were guarded with such care
that Cornwallis decided to allow his men, tired from their
rapid march, to rest until the following day. His plan was to
attack in front and along Washington’s right flank, and so force
him back upon the Delaware, where he would be obliged to
surrender. After observing the situation, Cornwallis went to
bed in high spirits, saying, “At last we have run down the
old fox, and will bag him in the morning.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s172'></a><span class='bold'>172. The Battle of Princeton.</span>—But in the morning the
“old fox” was gone. Ordering a force of men to keep fires
burning along the front of the camp, and to make a show of
strengthening the breastworks, Washington, with his main
army, crossed the Assanpink, and passing around the left flank
of the British, fell upon the force at Princeton at daybreak.
The movement, brilliantly conceived and carefully planned, was
completely successful. The British force at Princeton, after
losing about five hundred men, was cut in two, one part retreating
to New Brunswick and the other falling back to Trenton.
In this remarkable fight (January 3, 1777) the American
loss was less than one hundred.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s173'></a><span class='bold'>173. Retreat of Cornwallis.</span>—When Cornwallis found an
empty camp before him and heard the sound of cannon in the
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
direction of Princeton, he fell back at once, in order to protect
his stores. At Princeton the full meaning of the disaster
was revealed. Washington, at no time strong enough to risk a
general battle, now contented himself with destroying bridges,
harassing the enemy at every point, and finally taking up a
commanding position on the heights of Morristown. To support
himself on either flank, he ordered Heath to come down
from the highlands of the Hudson to Hackensack, and Putnam
to advance from Philadelphia to Trenton. Conrwallis, finding
himself thus confronted, withdrew to Paulus Hook and New
York. Thus, in the dead of winter, Washington, with a greatly
inferior force, had fought two successful battles, had taken
prisoners numbering more than a third of his whole army, and
had practically driven the British out of New Jersey. This
campaign saved the Revolution.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s174'></a><span class='bold'>174. Influence of Washington’s Success.</span>—The influence of
Washington’s success was shown at once in many ways. In
the first place it encouraged men to reënlist. The period for
which many of the recruits had gone into the army had expired
on the 1st of January. They had received very little
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
pay, and the paper money they got had now fallen greatly in
value. In the face of a defeat, few would have reëntered the
service; but for the payment of those who would reënlist,
Washington pledged his own fortune, and thus succeeded in
keeping his army intact. Another beneficial effect was shown
in the influence exerted upon the British army and the Tories.
Large numbers of Hessians now deserted, in order to avail
themselves of the offers of land that had been made by Congress;
and many men of
doubtful loyalty who, a
few months before, had
accepted the pardon
offered by Howe, now
made patriotic response
to the counter-proclamation
of Washington, requiring
that they should
either retire to the British
lines or take the
oath of allegiance to the
United States.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s175'></a><span class='bold'>175. Effects of the
Campaign in Europe.</span>—But
the most important
result of this remarkable
winter campaign was its
influence on the various
powers of Europe.
Washington’s generalship called out the hearty commendation
of Frederick the Great. In France a still greater interest was
awakened. In the autumn of 1776 Franklin had been sent to
Paris to secure a treaty. The sympathies of Louis XVI. were
with George III.; but, on the other hand, the French people
had hated England ever since the fall of Quebec. Throughout
France there was also beginning to be a widespread revolutionary
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
spirit. The disposition to recognize the independence
of the United States greatly increased as soon as there was any
probability of success. Though the French government still
hesitated, many brave officers, such as Lafayette<a id='r80'/><a href='#f80' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[80]</span></sup></a> and De
Kalb, privately offered their services to the American cause.
Lafayette, not yet twenty years of age and just married, threw
himself into the enterprise with unlimited enthusiasm. He
fitted out a ship at his own expense, and, leaving wife and
friends behind, devoted all his powers to the new cause. Along
with ten other officers, he arrived in America in the spring of
1777.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s176'></a><span class='bold'>176. Reorganization of the American Army.</span>—Congress now
reorganized the army and conferred upon Washington powers
that were practically those of a dictator. It also called for
an army of seventy-eight thousand men, sixty-six thousand
from the states and twelve thousand to be raised by Washington
and to be subject only to national control. But as Congress
had no power to enforce its laws, the full number of
troops called for was never provided. The army was, however,
somewhat enlarged in size and greatly improved in quality.</p>

The American troops, notwithstanding the energetic threats of Washington,
acted in a very cowardly manner and offered little resistance at Kipp’s
Bay, and Howe had no difficulty in landing. Had he pushed rapidly across
Manhattan Island, Putnam’s army would inevitably have been cut off. But
Mrs. Lindley Murray, whose mansion stood on Murray Hill, invited the British
officers to refresh themselves with luncheon, whereupon a halt was called,
and they were detained for two hours. During this time Putnam with his
army of four thousand marched up the west side of the island and soon
joined Washington.</p>

One of Washington’s captains, in his memoirs, relates a feat which illustrates
Washington’s spirit, as well as his great physical strength. He says
that, as they were breaking camp for the march, two soldiers had wound up
Washington’s tent around the tent pole, and were trying in vain to lift it to
the top of a high, loaded wagon. Washington came along in fiery impatience,
and seeing their fruitless efforts, seized the pole in the middle with one hand,
and threw it far above his head upon the top of the load.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s177'></a><span class='bold'>177. Plans of the British for 1777.</span>—The British saw that
if the next campaign was to be successful the war must be
pushed forward on a much larger scale. They determined on
three important movements. General Howe was to be reënforced
so that while holding New York he could open the
Hudson to Albany. From the north a new and more powerful
expedition, under General Burgoyne, was to repeat the attempt
of Sir Guy Carleton. A third expedition, under Colonel St.
Leger, was to ascend the St. Lawrence into Lake Ontario, and
from Oswego, after taking Fort Stanwix and clearing the Valley
of the Mohawk, unite with Burgoyne and Howe in the vicinity
of Albany. This comprehensive plan, if successful, would not
only separate New England from the rest of the colonies, but
would restore to the British the State of New York.</p>

ascending the St. Lawrence, entered Lake Champlain with
about eight thousand men, consisting partly of British veterans
and partly of Hessians. He had no difficulty in taking Fort
Ticonderoga, for General Gates in providing for its defense
had committed the same blunder that Howe had committed in
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
neglecting Dorchester Heights (§ <a href='#s149'>149</a>). On a high, rocky point
just south of the fort, General Phillips, one of Burgoyne's
officers, succeeded in planting siege guns; and Gates saw at
once that he must withdraw. But Burgoyne had no further
success. He had expected large reënforcements from the Tory
inhabitants, but in this he was disappointed. The preparations
for meeting the British
had been admirably
planned by General
Philip Schuyler,<a id='r82'/><a href='#f82' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[82]</span></sup></a>
who was in command
of the Northern
division of the army,
with headquarters at
Albany. His policy
was to impede the
march of the enemy
until the Americans
had time to gather
strength. When Burgoyne
began to press
his way southward,
he found that trees
had been felled across
every road, and the
best he could do was
to advance at the rate of only about a mile a day. Meanwhile
the inhabitants of the region round about were rising,
and sharpshooters began to harass him from every direction.
When he reached Whitehall he realized that he was in danger
of failing for want of provisions.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s179'></a><span class='bold'>179. The Bennington Expedition.</span>—Hearing that the Americans
had large stores at Bennington, Burgoyne now sent a
force of about one thousand men, under two Hessian officers,
Baum and Breymann, to capture them. The news of the
expedition spread rapidly, and hundreds of patriots flocked to
the defense. Among them was “good” Parson Allen, of
Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
who led an eager company
from the Berkshire Hills.
They were commanded by
General John Stark,<a id='r83'/><a href='#f83' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[83]</span></sup></a> who
had already distinguished
himself in the old French
War, and at Bunker Hill,
at Trenton, and at Princeton.
With his reënforcements,
Stark’s command
now outnumbered Baum’s
by two to one. Baum, seeing
that resistance was to
be offered, drew up his
troops on high ground near
the town and awaited an attack. On the morning of August
16, Stark stealthily threw a part of his men into the rear,
while in front he led the attack in person. The Germans,
thinking the troops in the rear were those “blessed” Tories
they had been looking for, were thrown into confusion on the
first attack from front and rear, and were soon forced to surrender.
Baum was mortally wounded, and Breymann, on his
way to the support of Baum, was met and defeated by a force
under General Seth Warner. This exploit, one of the most
brilliant of the war, cost the British two hundred and seven
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
killed and wounded, and more than seven hundred prisoners,
besides four field-pieces and a thousand stand of arms. The
loss of the Americans
amounted to forty
killed and forty-two
wounded.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s180'></a><span class='bold'>180. General Schuyler
Superseded.</span>—There
was much jealousy
between New
England and New
York, and much
consequent intrigue.
General Gates had
long been scheming
with Congress for
his own advancement.
He and his
friends were now able
to point out what the
people of New England
could do at Bennington, as contrasted with what General
Schuyler had been able to do in New York. The result of the
intrigue was that General Schuyler was removed and Gates
was placed in command in his stead.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General John Burgoyne.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s181'></a><span class='bold'>181. Movements of Burgoyne.</span>—No general change of policy
resulted from Schuyler’s removal. Burgoyne, finding himself
in danger of being hemmed in at Whitehall, was forced to move
toward the west and across the Hudson. Lincoln, with the
New England militia, closed in on his rear, while Putnam
arrived with a force from the Highlands and Arnold returned
from the Valley of the Mohawk, where he had aided in repulsing
St. Leger. It became daily more evident that unless
relief should arrive from General Howe, Burgoyne must either
defeat the Americans or surrender his whole army. No
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
reënforcements came, and two vigorous attempts at Freeman’s
Farm and Bemis Heights were frustrated by the skill and vigor
of the troops commanded by Arnold and Morgan. The source of
supplies for the British was now cut off; and, attempting to retreat
by way of Saratoga, Burgoyne found his army completely
surrounded by a force more than twice the size of his own. On
the 17th of October he was obliged to capitulate, and surrendered
with his entire force of more than seven thousand men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burgoyne demanded, and Gates consented, that the final act
should be deemed a “convention” instead of a surrender or
capitulation. Hence British historians are accustomed to refer
to the event as the “Convention of Saratoga.” The terms,
however, were not essentially different. The troops were
allowed to march out with the honors of war, and to march
to Boston, where they were to embark for home. An oath was
required that they would not again serve in the American
war. But a misunderstanding soon ensued, and Congress
repudiated the convention, in consequence of which Burgoyne
and his army were not sent home, but retained as prisoners.
Burgoyne, however, was permitted to go in the following
spring. He soon entered Parliament and became a stanch
defender of the American cause. The army was transferred to
a camp at Charlottesville, Virginia. Before 1783 they had dispersed
and many had settled in different parts of the country.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s182'></a><span class='bold'>182. St. Leger’s Campaign.</span>—St. Leger fared scarcely better
in his Western campaign. Advancing early in the spring from
Oswego, he reached, on August 3, Fort Stanwix, an important
point in Oneida County, now the city of Rome. He at once began
the siege. A few days later a force of about eight hundred militia,
gathered in the Mohawk Valley by General Herkimer, a veteran
of the French war, advanced for the relief of the fort. Near
Oriskany, however, his force fell into an ambuscade prepared
by Sir John Johnson, the leader of the Tories, and Brant, the
greatest of Mohawk chiefs. The battle was not decisive, but
the confidence of the Indians and Tories was completely broken,
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
and the Indians rapidly deserted. General Herkimer, severely
wounded, died some days afterward.<a id='r84'/><a href='#f84' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[84]</span></sup></a> The panic of the British
was increased by the approach of a force under Arnold,
which had been sent from Albany by Schuyler. St. Leger,
attacked by a vigorous sortie from the fort on the one side, and
by the surrounding patriots on the other, saw no chance of success,
and accordingly beat a hasty retreat.<a id='r85'/><a href='#f85' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[85]</span></sup></a> Thus both the
British expeditions in the North were complete failures.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s183'></a><span class='bold'>183. Blunder of the British Government.</span>—It had been the
design of the British government that General Howe, while
holding New York with a part of his force, should ascend the
Hudson with the other part for the reënforcement of Burgoyne;
but the British minister of war, instead of sending peremptory
orders, left much to the discretion of Howe.<a id='r86'/><a href='#f86' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[86]</span></sup></a> This gave an
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
opportunity for the scheming designs of General Lee, who was
still a prisoner of war in the hands of the British. Lee had
formerly been an officer in the British army, and Howe had
serious thoughts of hanging him for desertion; but Washington
wrote to Howe that he held five Hessian officers, whom he
should treat as hostages for Lee. The British, thereupon, not
daring to risk the anger of the Hessians that would surely follow
an execution, concluded to hold Lee simply as prisoner of
war, subject to exchange. But Lee, meantime, hoping to gain
the favor of Great Britain, drew up an elaborate plan, advising
the British in regard to the best method of assuring success.
This treasonable paper, indorsed as “Mr. Lee’s plan, March
29, 1777,” was not discovered until eighty years after the war.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s184'></a><span class='bold'>184. General Lee’s Advice.</span>—The advice of Lee was that
Howe direct all his energies to an attack upon Philadelphia;
and accordingly, as soon as the British commander heard of the
success of Burgoyne in taking Ticonderoga, he decided to
adopt this plan. His first purpose was, while leaving New
York in command of a small force, to advance with the greater
part of his army across New Jersey. But Washington, detecting
his purpose, threw up strong intrenchments at Middlebrook,
directly athwart his path. Howe thought it not prudent either
to attack directly, or, by marching around, to leave his opponent
in the rear. After nearly two months of unsuccessful effort to
bring Washington to battle, he changed his plan, and about the
middle of July withdrew his army to Staten Island.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s185'></a><span class='bold'>185. Movements of Howe.</span>—It became evident at once to
Washington that Howe’s purpose was to put his force upon a
fleet and either ascend the Hudson or sail to the south. The
American commander was not left very long in doubt. Leaving
eighteen hundred men under Sir Henry Clinton in New
York, Howe put to sea. Washington at once inferred that
Howe had gone south, but it was necessary to guard against
the possibility of his turning suddenly northward and advancing
up the Hudson. On account of supposed obstacles in the
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Delaware below Philadelphia, Howe passed on one hundred
miles farther, into Chesapeake Bay, and landed his army at
Elkton. Hearing of Howe’s arrival, Washington turned south
to meet him. In order to prevent a panic in Philadelphia, he
marched his army of eleven thousand men through the city.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s186'></a><span class='bold'>186. Battle of the Brandywine.</span>—It was evident that Howe
would advance upon Philadelphia without delay. Though
Washington had only eleven thousand men with whom to meet
Howe’s eighteen thousand, he decided to contest the advance
in a battle. Accordingly the Americans were posted along
the north bank of Brandywine Creek, with their center at
Chadd’s Ford. The position was admirably chosen, and the
forces were skillfully posted. But the British decided to force
the passage by means of a flank movement. On the morning
of September 11, Cornwallis, who commanded the British
left, marched up the river some eighteen miles by the Lancaster
road and crossed at Jeffrey’s Ford, intending to pass
around and attack the Americans in the rear. The success of
such a movement depended upon its secrecy. Washington,
fortunately, learned of the operation in time to order Sullivan
to change his front and meet Cornwallis as he approached.
But for this discovery the Americans would undoubtedly have
been routed and a large part of the army captured. Sullivan
fought with great bravery and skill, but he was not able to
repulse the enemy. In order to support Sullivan the whole
American army fell back, but it fell back in good order, chiefly
through the masterly skill of Greene. The Americans lost a
little more than a thousand, and the loss of the British was
about six hundred. The skill of the Americans in the retreat
was shown by the fact that Washington opposed the advance
of the British so vigorously that fifteen days were consumed
by Howe in a march of twenty-six miles to the city. On September
26 the British moved into Philadelphia. Cornwallis
was left in command of the city, while Howe established his
headquarters at the adjacent village of Germantown.
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s187'></a><span class='bold'>187. Needs of the British; Battle of Germantown.</span>—As the
American army had not been crippled, it was easy for Washington
to cut off the supplies of his enemy on the landward
side. The British were therefore dependent upon vessels from
the sea. To clear the river of obstructions a force was at once
sent from Philadelphia. Washington determined to take advantage
of this advance and to attack the main army at Germantown,
while the British were thus temporarily weakened.
Such extraordinary audacity on the part of an army which had
just been defeated seems never to have entered the minds of the
British. But on the evening of the 3d of October, Washington
began his march, with the purpose of nothing less than the
destruction or capture of Howe’s force. The town was to be
approached by four roads, the army consisting of two divisions,
under Greene and Sullivan. The advance arrived at the outskirts
of the village at daybreak, but unfortunately a heavy
fog came up, so that it was impossible for the different lines to
recognize one another. The Americans advanced successfully
in four different columns and seemed likely to push the British
back upon the river and completely overwhelm them; but, in
the center of the field, one of the brigades of General Greene’s
division came into collision with one from that of General
Sullivan. Each, supposing the enemy had been met, fired upon
the other.<a id='r87'/><a href='#f87' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[87]</span></sup></a> A confusion resulted which gave the British time to
recover, and the Americans were finally repulsed. This battle
is universally considered as one of the boldest fought by the
Americans, and it came wonderfully near to complete success.
Howe and Cornwallis were now left for the winter in Philadelphia,
while Washington took up his winter quarters at
Valley Forge, only a few miles away, where he could prevent
the British from foraging the country.</p>

The repulse of St. Leger and the relief of Fort Stanwix possess peculiar
interest from the fact that on that spot and on that day (August 6, 1777)
the American flag, substantially as we now know it, was first raised. Congress
had adopted the national flag in June, 1777. After a sortie which had
been successful in driving back the besieging force of St. Leger, Colonel
Willett, the patriot in command, hoisted a captured British flag, and put over
it a rude banner of stars and stripes hastily patched together from a white
shirt, a blue jacket, and a red flannel petticoat of a soldier’s wife.</p>

While the state of the country and the roads made it impossible for the
British divisions to support, or even communicate with, each other, the Americans,
working from within, could strike in either direction, wherever the blow
would be the most effective. As the bodies of British troops were to work from
without, toward a common center, it was of the highest importance to them
that each should be under specific orders when and how to move. This was
understood by the British ministry, but for some reason long unaccountable,
Howe received no specific orders whatever. Such an order was really made,
but when it had been prepared for the signature of the British minister of
war, Lord George Germain, he petulantly objected to the clerical work, and
ordered that a fair copy should be made. That night the minister went to
his country seat, and the copy was placed in a pigeonhole to await his return.
It was forgotten until long after Burgoyne surrendered. The delayed order
directed Howe to ascend the Hudson and coöperate with Burgoyne.</p>

<h3 id='s188a'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>A WINTER OF DISCOURAGEMENT.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s188'></a><span class='bold'>188. Change in the Commissariat of the Army.</span>—Nearly a
year before the close of the campaigns just described, Congress
had very unwisely determined to make a change in the control
of the commissariat of the army. Up to this time it had been
a part of the military service and had been successfully managed
by Colonel Trumbull; but it was now decided to appoint two
officers,—one for procuring the supplies, and another for distributing
them. This system of divided responsibility caused
the greatest discomfort to the army.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s189'></a><span class='bold'>189. The Winter at Valley Forge.</span>—Washington’s force, in
its winter quarters at Valley Forge, was subjected to terrible
suffering. On the 22d of December two brigades became
mutinous, because for three days they had gone without bread
and for two days without meat. On the following day Washington
informed Congress that he had in camp two thousand
eight hundred and ninety-eight men “unfit for duty because
they are barefooted and otherwise naked.” Even when his
army first marched into winter quarters, their route could be
traced on the snow by the blood that oozed from their bare
and frost-bitten feet; and matters grew worse as the winter
advanced. This condition was not owing to any actual want
of supplies, for it was afterward found that “hogsheads
of shoes, stockings, and clothing were lying at different
places on the roads and in the woods, perishing for want of
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
teams or of money to pay the teamsters.” It was in consequence
of gross mismanagement on the part of the commissariat,
that the winter at Valley Forge was one of such
memorable suffering and death.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s190'></a><span class='bold'>190. The Coming of Baron von Steuben.</span>—But the winter, sad
as it was in most respects, brought one great advantage.
Agents in Europe succeeded in persuading one of the most
efficient soldiers from the staff of Frederick the Great to offer
his experience to the American cause. This was Baron von
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Steuben.<a id='r88'/><a href='#f88' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[88]</span></sup></a> He had gone through every grade of the Prussian
service up to the rank of marshal, and his knowledge of military
drill caused him
to be appointed inspector
general of the
American armies. It
would be difficult to
overestimate the value
of his services. He
found the raw American
troops completely
unaccustomed to the
exact military methods
of Europe, and he
set himself to teach
them all the arts and
methods of the regular
soldier. Taking
a musket in his hand,
this Prussian officer
of highest rank devoted
himself from
morning till night to
the most elementary, as well as the most intricate, parts of
military drill. Thus, in the course of the terrible winter at
Valley Forge, Baron von Steuben brought the army into a condition
of efficiency it had never known before.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s191'></a><span class='bold'>191. General Causes of Discontent.</span>—During this winter there
were numerous matters that occasioned great anxiety. It is at
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
the present time easy to see that Washington’s plan of conducting
the war was the only one that gave any promise of success.
But it was one that could be easily misunderstood and misrepresented.
It was possible for unfriendly critics to say that
he had been driven from New York; that he had lost Philadelphia;
and that he had been defeated in two important
battles. It was also easy to overlook the far more important
fact that he had kept his army intact, and that he had managed
to fight and to avoid fighting in such a way as to keep the
enemy occupied at the center so that the great object of the
British campaign, the opening of the Hudson, was completely
frustrated.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Horatio Gates.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s192'></a><span class='bold'>192. Intrigues of Gates and Others.</span>—The country was not
lacking in people who were ready to seize upon opportunities
for slander and intrigue. John Hancock, the first president
of Congress, had been ambitious for the position of commander
in chief, and, as many charged, had, in consequence of his failure
to obtain that office, resigned his presidency in disgust.
The impetuous Samuel Adams, and even John Adams, had
uttered loud complaints over what was called the “Fabian
policy,” and had clamored for a short and decisive war. The
success of the Northern army had enabled Gates,<a id='r89'/><a href='#f89' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[89]</span></sup></a> who was
the arch-intriguer of the time, to present his claims with some
show of plausibility. By distributing promises throughout the
army he created a widespread sentiment in behalf of Washington’s
removal and his own appointment. His friends sent
letters from every quarter to members of Congress, representing
that before Gates had commanded the army of the North, Burgoyne
had had uninterrupted success, and that immediately
after Gates’s appointment the coils were rapidly thrown about
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
the British commander until he was compelled to surrender.
Of course no mention was made of the fact that the victory
at Bennington was
solely due to Stark
and his New England
volunteers;
that the repulse of
St. Leger was due
to Herkimer and
Arnold; and that
the two victories
over Burgoyne were
due chiefly to the
vigor and skill of
Arnold and Morgan.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s193'></a><span class='bold'>193. The Conway
Cabal.</span>—The most
conspicuous manager
of the intrigue
was an Irish-American
officer, by the
name of Conway,
who had not been promoted by Washington as rapidly as
he had desired. Congress, notwithstanding the opposition of
Washington, was disposed to advance Conway and a number
of other subordinate officers. Washington did not hesitate to
express his disapproval, and even went so far as to say, “It
will be impossible for me to be of any further service if such
insuperable difficulties are thrown in my way.” This was very
justly interpreted as a threat to resign, and it was effective.
But the anger of Conway toward Washington was naturally
increased. The intrigues that followed have passed into history
as the “Conway Cabal.” The only success of the movement
was to induce Congress to reorganize the “Board of
War” and make Gates its president. Public sentiment was
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
so overwhelmingly favorable to Washington, that Congress
ventured to go no farther. Extracts from some of the letters
were published and thus the whole spirit of the intrigue was
revealed. The scornful silence of Washington, who never in
his life condescended to defend himself, reacted greatly in his
favor. In the end, the commander in chief was stronger in
his position than ever. Gates resigned in disgust and returned
to his plantation in Virginia.</p>

<h3 id='s194a'>PROSPECTS BRIGHTEN.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s194'></a><span class='bold'>194. Treaty with France.</span>—America had now single-handedly
carried on the war for more than two years, but the defeat of
Burgoyne and St. Leger in the North, and the vigor with which
Washington conducted the campaign in New Jersey and about
Philadelphia, convinced the French that the time for recognition
had arrived. Treaties were signed on February 6, 1778, between
France and the United States, in which France pledged herself
to furnish ships, as well as men, and the Americans, on their
part, agreed not to cease the conflict until Great Britain acknowledged
their independence. Thereafter England was at war
with France, as well as with America.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s195'></a><span class='bold'>195. Howe succeeded by Sir Henry Clinton.</span>—The French
alliance obliged the British to change their plan of action.
Howe, who had never believed in the British policy, now
resigned and returned to England, and Sir Henry Clinton
succeeded him in command. Anticipating the approach of the
French fleet, and evidently fearing that the French and Americans
together would prove too strong for the British at New
York, Clinton decided to evacuate Philadelphia. Washington,
whose army, notwithstanding the sufferings at Valley Forge,
showed the effects of the careful drilling by Baron von Steuben,
determined to attack the British on their northern march.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s196'></a><span class='bold'>196. The Battle of Monmouth.</span>—The place chosen was Monmouth,
and the battle took place on Sunday, the 28th of
June. The northern portion of the American force was
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
ordered to attack the British on their flank, while Washington
himself, by closing in upon their rear with the southern division,
hoped to overwhelm them. General Charles Lee, whose
treason was still unknown to Washington, had been exchanged,
and, as senior major general, had command of the northern
portion of the army, consisting of about six thousand men.
Washington ordered him to attack Clinton’s flank with vigor,
while the commander in chief himself, with a still larger
force, was to attack at the moment when the enemy had been
thrown into confusion. Lee, however, on reaching the British,
made only a feeble show of advance and then ordered his
troops to withdraw. Washington, informed of the situation
by a messenger from Lafayette, rushed forward in furious
anger and demanded an explanation. As no satisfactory
reason for his retreat could be given, Washington ordered Lee
to the rear, and, galloping along the disordered mass of retreating
troops, shouted for a halt, and then reformed the lines.
The results of the winter’s drill were at once felt, for in the
face of the enemy and under a hard fire the American troops
fell into order, wheeled about, and rushed forward to a new
attack. The British were driven from the ground they had
gained; but night came on, and the two armies occupied the
positions held before the battle. Before morning the British
resumed their way to New York.<a id='r90'/><a href='#f90' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[90]</span></sup></a> After the battle, Lee was
tried by a court-martial, consisting of several of the most
eminent officers in the army, and was dismissed from the
service.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s197'></a><span class='bold'>197. First Efforts of the French.</span>—The first efforts of the
French to assist the Americans were not fortunate. Count
D’Estaing, a kinsman of Lafayette, arrived on the 8th of
July with a squadron of twelve ships of the line and six
frigates, and a land force on board of four thousand men.
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
His fleet was larger than that of Clinton; but as two of his
vessels could not cross the New York bar, he was not strong
enough to venture an attack. The next movement was an
effort to coöperate with the land force of General Sullivan in
reducing Newport, Rhode Island. This point had been taken
by the British soon after their expulsion from Boston, and
had been held to the present time. Sullivan now approached
with a large force from the land side, and D’Estaing was to
prevent reënforcements by sea. It appeared certain that the
post would be taken. But soon Lord Howe approached with
his fleet, and D’Estaing moved out for action. In the nick
of time one of the most terrific storms ever known came on
and dispersed both fleets. D’Estaing felt compelled to put
into Boston for repairs. While he was there word came that
Clinton had sent five thousand men to relieve the Newport
garrison. Lafayette galloped seventy miles in seven hours to
obtain aid from D’Estaing, but it was too late. The siege had
to be raised, and soon D’Estaing moved off to the West Indies.
These movements of the French were very severely criticised
by the Americans, and in consequence, at one time the French
admiral thought seriously of taking his fleet back to France in
disgust. It was only the great tact and skill of Washington
that persuaded him to remain. His going to the West Indies
was not without importance, for Clinton felt obliged to send five
thousand troops for the support of the British in the islands.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s198'></a><span class='bold'>198. British Movement on the South.</span>—The efforts thus far
made to destroy the revolutionary army by striking at its
center having failed, the British determined in the spring of
1779 upon a new policy. It was decided to attack the South,
partly for the purpose of bringing the Southern states completely
under their control, and partly for the purpose of drawing
off a portion of Washington’s army. In the execution of
this plan they had no difficulty in overrunning Georgia and
South Carolina, but Washington understood perfectly well that
the temporary loss of the Southern states would not mean the
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
loss of the cause if
the Middle states and
New England could
be kept together.
He therefore refused
to weaken his grip
upon the Hudson.
In July, General Anthony
Wayne<a id='r91'/><a href='#f91' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[91]</span></sup></a> took
by storm the seemingly
impregnable position
at Stony Point
on the Hudson, in one
of the most brilliant
assaults of the war.
His fearless dash,
which was made at
midnight, caused him
to be known as “Mad
Anthony.”</p>

<h3 id='s199a'>CONDITIONS WEST OF THE ALLEGHANIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s199'></a><span class='bold'>199. British Control in the West.</span>—At the outbreak of the
war the vast region west of the mountains was already the
field of much strife between the Indians and the few settlers
that had pushed their way along the valleys into what was then
the far West. The territory between the mountains and the
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
Mississippi River, a region twice as large as the German
Empire, was still an almost unbroken wilderness. French
settlements had been established at Detroit, at Vincennes on
the Wabash, and at
Natchez, Kaskaskia,
and Cahokia on the
Mississippi. But
these fortified hamlets
since the fall of
Quebec had been controlled
by British
garrisons. Though
the region was thus
under British dominion,
it was
claimed by Massachusetts,
Connecticut,
New York, Virginia,
Maryland, North and South Carolina, and Georgia by
authority of their original charters. The possession of the
whole region was therefore involved in the war.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Wayne’s Dispatch to Washington.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s200'></a><span class='bold'>200. Settlements in Tennessee and Kentucky.</span>—Virginia and
North Carolina were the first to send explorers and settlers
into this distant region. Before the outbreak of the war,
Daniel Boone<a id='r92'/><a href='#f92' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[92]</span></sup></a> had explored the Kentucky Kiver, and Virginia
surveyors had gone down the Ohio as far as the present site of
Louisville, which was soon after named in honor of our new
ally, the reigning king of France, Louis XVI. Virginians
entered the country as settlers, and their sympathy with the
revolutionary movement was so intense that they named one of
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
their principal towns Lexington, in honor of the village where
the first shots had been fired. The pioneers of most influence
in Tennessee were James Robertson and John Sevier, who
played a part as explorers and organizers much like the parts
played by Daniel Boone and
James Harrod in Kentucky.
In both of these regions laws
were enacted and courts
instituted, and when the
Continental Congress met,
delegates were sent to it to
represent the interests of
the new settlements. The
one was called the State of
Transylvania and the other
the County of Kentucky.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s201'></a><span class='bold'>201. Border Warfare.</span>—The
early years of these settlements
were periods of constant
hardship and of strife
with the Indians. Even
before the Revolutionary
War broke out, the Indians organized for systematic resistance.
This was the result partly of outrageous treatment by the white
settlers, and partly of repeated Indian depredations.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s202'></a><span class='bold'>202. Lord Dunmore’s War.</span>—Lord Dunmore, the last royal
governor of Virginia, sent out in 1773 an injudicious order
which led to an outbreak of hostilities all along the line. The
immediate cause of the war was the fiendish act of a wretch by
the name of Greathouse, who decoyed the family of the friendly
Indian chief, Logan, consisting of nine men, women, and children,
into his rum shop, and after getting them intoxicated,
butchered them all in cold blood. The justly outraged Indians
rushed to arms from all quarters. The war which followed
was characterized by the murdering of women and children
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
and the burning of cabins and wigwams, until it was ended by
the decisive battle of Point Pleasant on the Great Kanawha, on
October 10, 1774. The Indians, commanded by the Shawnee
chief, Cornstalk, were utterly defeated by the settlers under
Andrew Lewis, and were glad to secure peace by surrendering
all their claims to lands south of the Ohio.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s203'></a><span class='bold'>203. Warfare in Tennessee.</span>—The westward movement from
North Carolina through the Great Smoky Mountains into the
country now known as Tennessee was also the occasion of
numerous conflicts. In 1770 the settlers had reached the
Watauga. Forts were erected, and the settlement soon assumed
a thriving condition. But conflicts were not long postponed.
The most warlike and powerful of the Southern tribes of
Indians were the Cherokees, and on the outbreak of the Revolution
they took sides with the British. The Indians even
advanced into South Carolina and Georgia; but they were
unable to hold their ground, and when in 1776 they attacked
the Watauga settlement, they were so completely defeated by
the troops of Robertson and Sevier that they soon afterward
were willing to make peace. In 1777 they renounced the larger
part of their claims to lands between the Tennessee and the
Cumberland. Thus Tennessee, as well as Kentucky, was secure
for the future Union.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s204'></a><span class='bold'>204. Organization of Tories and Indians in the Northwest.</span>—Meanwhile
matters of no less importance were occurring on the
northwest frontier. Washington fully understood the necessity
of taking from the British as much as possible of that
vast territory which extends from the Catskills to the Mississippi
River, and which had been made a part of Canada by
the Quebec Act (§ <a href='#s136'>136</a>). This was by no means an easy task.
The Six Nations (§ <a href='#s3'>3</a>), constituting the most powerful Indian
confederation ever known, were under the immediate leadership
of the greatest of all Indian chiefs, Joseph Brant,
and under the influence of Sir John Johnson, the most formidable
of the Tories. Brant had been liberally educated in
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
Mr. Wheelock’s School, afterward Dartmouth College, and had
even visited England and had dined with Burke and Sheridan;
but his education seemed only to sharpen his wits and make
him the better able to use the characteristics of other Indians.
Though he exerted his influence to prevent the killing of women
and children, as a strategist he was unequaled among savages,
and on the battlefield he could out-yell any other chief.
Throughout the West the Indians had generally combined
with the Tories and the British. Two forces were now organized,
one at Niagara and one at Detroit, for carrying out
their designs.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s205'></a><span class='bold'>205. The Wyoming and Cherry Valley Massacres.</span>—In the
summer of 1778 twelve hundred Tories and Iroquois, led
by John Butler, advanced stealthily from Niagara toward the
southeast and fell upon the peaceful inhabitants of the Wyoming
Valley in Pennsylvania. Hundreds of innocent inhabitants
were tortured and scalped, and the horrors of the massacre
sent a pang into all parts of the civilized world. Similar outrages
occurred at Cherry Valley and elsewhere, and every
settlement was in danger. Prisoners who refused to give information
were put to torture with ingenious cruelty.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s206'></a><span class='bold'>206. Sullivan’s Expedition.</span>—In order to destroy the power
of the Six Nations and put an end to this savage method of
warfare, Washington decided to send out a strong force in the
summer of 1779. The command of the expedition, having been
declined by Gates, devolved upon Sullivan,<a id='r93'/><a href='#f93' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[93]</span></sup></a> who had orders to
lay waste the entire country of the Iroquois. The right wing
of his army, under General James Clinton, advanced up the
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
valley of the Mohawk, while Sullivan himself, with a force of
about five thousand men, pushed into the valley of the Susquehanna.
Both forces destroyed the Indian villages and the
growing crops wherever they went.
Finally, meeting the united forces
of Johnson, Butler, and Brant
near Newtown (now Elmira), Sullivan
achieved a complete victory,
August 29.<a id='r94'/><a href='#f94' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[94]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s207'></a><span class='bold'>207. Destruction of the Six Nations.</span>—Sullivan’s
forces then advanced
northward in two divisions,
burning villages, cutting down fruit
trees, and destroying the growing
corn in all directions. After a successful
march of more than seven
hundred miles, during which he not only temporarily, but permanently,
through his destruction of their harvests, broke the
power of the Six Nations, Sullivan reached New Jersey in
October. The suffering which resulted to the Indians from
this expedition was greatly increased by the intense cold of
the following winter.<a id='r95'/><a href='#f95' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[95]</span></sup></a> The horrors of the period, however,
cannot be understood without a study of painful and revolting
details. In no part of the country was the suffering greater
than in central and eastern New York during this contest of
Indians, Tories, and patriots. In Tryon County the population
was reduced to one-third of its former number, and among
those who remained there are said to have been three hundred
widows and two thousand orphans.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s208'></a><span class='bold'>208. George Rogers Clark.</span>—An expedition of even greater
importance had been undertaken the previous year, still farther
west, by George Rogers
Clark.<a id='r96'/><a href='#f96' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[96]</span></sup></a> Colonel Hamilton,
commander of the British
at Detroit, had planned a
series of movements with
the intention of taking
possession of the whole
western region north of the
Ohio. Clark, a Virginian
who had settled in Kentucky,
had become thoroughly
acquainted with
frontier manners and
methods. In the autumn
of 1777, he learned of Burgoyne’s
surrender. Divining
the importance of the
West, he at once sent
scouts throughout the
region known as the Illinois
country. As a result of the information thus received,
this adventurous frontiersman, only twenty-five years old,
formed the bold project of conquering from the British the
whole of the vast region extending from the Alleghanies to
the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s209'></a><span class='bold'>209. Clark’s Expedition.</span>—Accordingly, having secured permission
from the authorities of Virginia, Clark, taking a force
of one hundred and eighty men, with boats and artillery,
started in the spring of 1778, at Pittsburg, for a voyage
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
down the river to the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi.
He had no difficulty in capturing Kaskaskia, a small post
not very far north of the modern Cairo. Thence he sent messengers
to Vincennes, which agreed to submit to him. Later,
however, he learned that the British under Colonel Hamilton
had retaken the fort. Sending his cannon on a boat to patrol
the Ohio and the Wabash, Clark took his men across Illinois
in a winter’s march, often through mud and water knee deep,
and appeared before Vincennes. The village at once yielded,
and the people united with Clark in assaulting the fort.
Hamilton was soon obliged to surrender with his whole force.
By this brilliant expedition, the frontier was extended to the
Mississippi River. The importance of the movement could
hardly be understood at the time, but the history of the next
hundred years revealed it in many very interesting ways.</p>

<h3 id='s210a'>THE VICTORIES OF PAUL JONES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s210'></a><span class='bold'>210. Early Condition of the Navy.</span>—Before the war the Americans
had no navy, for there was no national government, and the
individual colonies, under the Navigation Acts, had no opportunities
for the development of foreign trade. Soon after the
outbreak of hostilities, however, Congress provided for arming
vessels, not so much to fight the British warships as to prey upon
British commerce. Franklin, as minister to France after 1778,
was authorized by Congress to commission vessels to scour the
waters for British prizes.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Captain John Paul Jones.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s211'></a><span class='bold'>211. The Bon Homme Richard.</span>—The most famous of these
cruisers was a merchant ship that had been hastily fitted up
for war and given the name of <span class='it'>Bon Homme Richard</span>. This
vessel, commanded by John Paul Jones,<a id='r97'/><a href='#f97' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[97]</span></sup></a> a Scotchman who had
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
renounced his country and lived some years in America, made
havoc among the British merchantmen, especially in the British
and Irish Channels and off the east coast of Scotland. On the
23d of September, 1779, Jones, with two small accompanying
vessels, met the
British frigate <span class='it'>Serapis</span>,
with similar support,
convoying a small
fleet of merchantmen,
off Flamborough
Head. The <span class='it'>Serapis</span> was
slightly more powerful
than the <span class='it'>Richard</span>, but
Jones did not hesitate
to attack, and the result
was one of the
most obstinate and
bloody battles in all
naval history. Jones
received no assistance
from his attendant
ships, which even fired
into the <span class='it'>Richard</span>. After
both ships had
been partially disabled,
Jones ran alongside the
<span class='it'>Serapis</span> and lashed them together. From that moment a terrible
battle with canister, musket balls, hand grenades, and cutlasses
went on, until more than half of all the men engaged were either
killed or disabled. The <span class='it'>Serapis</span> finally surrendered, but it was
immediately found that the <span class='it'>Richard</span> had been so riddled with
shot that it was sinking, and Jones therefore was obliged to
transfer his men to the other vessel. A few hours later the
<span class='it'>Richard</span> went down.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s212'></a><span class='bold'>212. Importance of Jones’s Victory.</span>—This desperate naval
battle was important for two reasons: first, it everywhere gave
the Americans a reputation as sailors; and secondly, it led to an
important international dispute. Jones took the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> into a
port in Holland. The British at once demanded that the commander
of the <span class='it'>Richard</span> should be given up to be tried as a pirate.
The Dutch refused, on the ground that Jones had done only
what the British had long been doing. This, with some other
complications, led to war between Holland and Great Britain.
The English, in consequence, were then at war with Holland,
as well as with America and France. Spain was also drawn
in as the ally of France. Russia had long been apparently on
the point of joining in the contest, but the Empress Catherine,
before taking a final step, wrote a personal letter of inquiry to
Frederick the Great, who advised her to keep out of the trouble.
Thus England, left without a single ally, found herself confronted
by three of the most powerful naval forces of continental Europe.
The united fleets of France and Spain, even without the help of
Holland, were scarcely weaker than the British fleet, and they
at once threatened, while the English were occupied in America,
not only to destroy the commerce of England in the open seas,
but also to recover Gibraltar, and to overwhelm all the English
possessions in the West Indies. The influence of these alliances
on the American war may be inferred from the fact that while
in 1779 the British had three hundred and fourteen thousand
men under arms, not a tenth of that number were at any time
in America.</p>

<h3 id='s213a'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>THE WAR IN THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s213'></a><span class='bold'>213. Clinton’s Success in the South.</span>—Sir Henry Clinton, even
without a very large force, found it possible to carry out his
designs in the South with energy and success. Leaving Knyphausen
a part of his force to defend New York, he started,
December 26, 1779, with eight thousand men, for the South.
Savannah fell into his hands, and a little later he invested
Charleston. General Lincoln made the great mistake of allowing
himself with five thousand men to be shut up in that
city with no means of escape, and accordingly he was forced
to surrender on the 12th of May, 1780, with his whole army.
This was the severest blow the Americans had received. Clinton
at once put Lord Cornwallis in command, after issuing a
proclamation, threatening to deal with all who did not return
to allegiance as traitors and rebels. He then went back to
New York. South Carolina was soon overrun by the troops of
Cornwallis, Tarleton, and Ferguson.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s214'></a><span class='bold'>214. Northward Movement of the British.</span>—The American
standards, however, were kept flying by the heroic deeds of
the partisan generals, Marion and Sumter. The British advanced
northward, hoping to find very little opposition before
reaching Virginia. Washington recommended the appointment
of Greene to the command of the Southern army; but the
intriguers were successful, and Congress recalled Gates from
his retirement, in the hope that the experience of Burgoyne
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
would be repeated by Cornwallis.<a id='r98'/><a href='#f98' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[98]</span></sup></a> But in North Carolina
there had been no Schuyler to plan the campaign in advance,
and there was no
Arnold or Morgan to
assist in carrying it
out. Gates revealed
his inefficiency at
every step; and when
the two armies finally
came together, on the
16th of August, 1780,
his troops suffered at
Camden the most disastrous
defeat ever
inflicted on an American
army. Though
the American force
was superior to the
British, it was routed,
driven in utter confusion
from the field,
and dispersed. Gates
himself, after committing
a succession of gross blunders, crowned his ignominy
by joining in the panic and finally leaving the army
to its fate. In four days he reached Hillsborough, some two
hundred miles away. Thus the worst fears of Washington
were fully realized, and the whole South was practically in
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
the grasp of the British. Clinton might well suppose the end to
be near at hand.</p>

<h3 id='s215a'>THE TREASON OF BENEDICT ARNOLD.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s215'></a><span class='bold'>215. Growth of Arnold’s Disaffection.</span>—As if to complete a
year of disasters, the country received a terrible shock in the
treason of one of its foremost officers. Benedict Arnold, who
had been one of the most skillful, as well as one of the most
energetic of commanders, had been slighted in various ways.
Washington had repeatedly recommended that he be advanced
from brigadier to major general, but Congress promoted five
officers of inferior rank over him. These facts not unnaturally
soured his temper, so that he was inclined to find fault with
everything. While he was in this mood Washington assigned
him to the command in Philadelphia, after the withdrawal
of Clinton, where he was noted for luxurious tastes and extravagant
methods of life. Meanwhile he became engaged
to Margaret Shippen, a beautiful daughter of one of the most
prominent Tory families in Philadelphia. Before many months,
his views had drifted completely over to those of the moderate
Tory party. After the surrender of Burgoyne, the British
government had offered the colonies all the constitutional
guarantees they had asked for before the Declaration of Independence,
and Arnold, as well as the Tories generally, believed
that these terms should have been accepted.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s216'></a><span class='bold'>216. Charges by Congress against Arnold.</span>—Arnold was
seriously contemplating the advisability of resigning his post,
owing to the hostility of the Executive Council, when charges of
peculation and misconduct were brought against him. Thereupon
he promptly demanded an investigation. He was acquitted,
not only by a committee of Congress, but afterward
by a court-martial, of all the charges excepting two of very
trifling importance. But he felt insulted and persecuted. His
hatred of Congress became intense, and accordingly, in the
course of the six months from January to July, 1780, he
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
devised one of the most infamous schemes in history. He
entered into correspondence with the British commander, for
the purpose of betraying the American cause. His letters,
signed “Gustavus,” were answered by the British adjutant
general, Major John André, over the signature “John
Anderson.” But nothing definite came of the matter until
Arnold determined to ask Washington for the command of
West Point, in order that this most important stronghold in
the whole country might be turned over to the enemy for a
good price. His request was granted, and his nefarious plans
came alarmingly near to success.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s217'></a><span class='bold'>217. Meeting of Arnold and André.</span>—In September the agreement
had advanced so far that a personal interview between
the officers in correspondence was thought desirable. The
British fleet, temporarily under the command of Admiral
Rodney, who had recently come from the West Indies, showed
signs of great activity. It was the intention at an opportune
moment to sail up the Hudson and make a show of attacking
the fort. Arnold was to surrender it, with only a faint
appearance of resistance. The American traitor was to sell
his country for fifty thousand dollars and a commission in the
British army. On the 18th of September, Washington left the
fort for a conference with Rochambeau at Hartford; and this
absence afforded the coveted opportunity. André, ascending
the Hudson in the British ship <span class='it'>Vulture</span> to a point near the
fort, went ashore and passed the night with Arnold a few
miles below the fortress. After some delays the agreement
was completed, but in returning André was obliged to cross
and go down the river along the eastern shore.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s218'></a><span class='bold'>218. Arrest of André.</span>—At Tarrytown, in a strip of neutral
territory between the two armies, he was arrested by three
young men headed by John Paulding. One of the party had
on a Hessian uniform, and when they confronted André, who
was clad in citizen’s dress, he accosted them as friends, supposing
they were British. They immediately declared themselves
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
to be Americans, however, and roughly ordered him to
dismount. Proceeding to search him, they found the fatal
articles of agreement in his boots. As, however, they were
unsigned, Colonel Jameson, to whom the documents and
the prisoner were delivered, decided to forward the papers
to Washington, and to send a message concerning the affair to
Arnold.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s219'></a><span class='bold'>219. Escape of Arnold.</span>—Washington returned to West Point,
September 25, and received the papers soon after his arrival.
The letter had reached Arnold only in time to enable him to
escape by taking a boat and rowing swiftly down to the British
ship which was awaiting André. When Washington read the
documents he burst into tears, and with choking voice disclosed
the affair to Lafayette and Knox and the other officers about
him.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s220'></a><span class='bold'>220. André’s Execution.</span>—André was put upon trial by a
court-martial consisting of fourteen officers, including Greene,
Steuben, and Lafayette, and was
pronounced guilty. Though every
effort was made by Clinton to save
his life, Washington was inflexible,
and, on the morning of October 2,
he died upon the gallows the death
of a spy. Though the English
have been inclined to dispute the
justice of Washington’s action,
the latest and most judicious of
British historians of this period,
Mr. Lecky, after a full examination
of the facts, reaches the conclusion
that his condemnation was
justified by the usages of war. Benedict Arnold’s treason has
properly given his name an immortality of infamy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>

<h3 id='s221a'>CAUSES OF DISCOURAGEMENT.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s221'></a><span class='bold'>221. Discontent in the Army.</span>—The treason of Arnold was
followed by events in the army which added to the general
distress and anxiety. The best of the troops were those that
had enlisted during the hopeful period just after Burgoyne’s
surrender, in 1777. The term of enlistment was “three years,
or during the war.” The troops claimed that, as the three
years would expire at the end of December, they would then be
free. The officers interpreted the law as meaning that in case
the war should continue more than three years, the soldiers
would be bound to service until its close. The army had
many causes of complaint. Paper money issued by Congress
had now become nearly worthless. With this money Congress
was reluctant to pay the troops, but there was no other. At
the end of December many of the regiments had received no
pay for sixteen months, and supplies of clothing and shoes
were so small that when January approached, many soldiers
were barefooted and in rags. The winter of 1780–1781 saw
scarcely less suffering than did the winter at Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s222'></a><span class='bold'>222. Spirit of Mutiny.</span>—On New Year’s Day, 1781, thirteen
hundred Pennsylvania troops claimed that their time had expired,
and, seizing six field-pieces, set out for Philadelphia
to secure their rights from Congress. After much parleying,
Congress, through its president, promised to give them certificates
of indebtedness and their formal discharge. Thus it was
settled that the men who had enlisted on the ambiguous terms
might go when the three years had expired. By this decision
Washington’s army not only lost its best troops, but was agitated
by the mutinous spirit of others who were tempted to try
the same method. On the 20th of January a part of the New
Jersey troops mutinied without any adequate reason, and were
not subdued until they were met by a brigade of troops from
Massachusetts. The insurgents were soon brought to order, and
two of the ringleaders were shot by Washington’s command.
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
Thus came to a close the most discouraging year of the whole
war.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s223'></a><span class='bold'>223. Discouragements at the Beginning of 1781.</span>—The disasters
that had come to the Americans in 1780 gave the British many
reasons to hope for a successful end of the contest in the summer
of 1781. After the defeat of Gates at Camden there was a
reasonable prospect that Cornwallis, having completely established
British authority in the farther South, would be able to
overrun Virginia and then unite with Clinton in overwhelming
Washington. This feeling received encouragement from the discontented
state of the American army, but in their predictions
the British greatly underrated the ingenuity and the resources of
the American commander in chief. Congress, which had chosen
to disregard Washington’s former recommendation by sending
Gates to the South, was now, late in 1780, when there was only
a forlorn hope of success, quite willing that the commander
should designate the general to meet Cornwallis. Washington
selected Greene, the man he had recommended the year before.
The latter did not reach Charlotte in North Carolina until
the 2d of December; but he found that much had already been
done by Marion, Sumter, and Morgan to counteract the effects
of disaster and to keep alive the patriotic spirit.</p>

<h3 id='s224a'>AMERICAN SUCCESSES IN THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s224'></a><span class='bold'>224. Victory at King’s Mountain.</span>—Soon after the defeat of
Gates at Camden, in the summer of 1780, Cornwallis had begun
a northward movement. He sent on in advance two divisions:
one under Ferguson, with about fourteen hundred men, and
one under Tarleton,<a id='r99'/><a href='#f99' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[99]</span></sup></a> with about the same number. Ferguson
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
soon found that patriots had arisen on every side. Enterprising
hunters and backwoodsmen had come from all parts of
the North and West,
as well as from the
neighboring regions,
until nearly three
thousand were in the
path of his progress.
Thwarted at every
step, he was finally
obliged to look for a
way of retreat. His
messengers to Cornwallis
and his scouts
were everywhere shot
down as fast as they
were sent out. His
force was finally
brought to bay on the
top of King’s Mountain,
where after desperate
fighting it was
compelled to surrender,
October 7. As a
result of this battle,
in which Ferguson was
killed and nearly four
hundred men were lost, Cornwallis was obliged to fall back
to Winnsborough.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s225'></a><span class='bold'>225. Victory at Cowpens.</span>—Against the force of Tarleton,
Greene sent General Daniel Morgan,<a id='r100'/><a href='#f100' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[100]</span></sup></a> who had already shown
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
great ability at Quebec, at Trenton, and at Saratoga. The
forces of Tarleton and Morgan were about equal. The American
commander chose, as a spot for the battle, an open plain
where cattle had been herded, called the “Cowpens.” The
British, though wearied after a difficult march of five hours,
decided to advance at once to a front attack. The first
volleys of the Americans caused the enemy’s line to stagger
and fall back. As the British came on a second time to the
charge, Colonel Washington, a relative of the commander in
chief, who led the cavalry, swept around the American left and
struck the British in the flank. At this moment the Continentals
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
rushed forward in a bayonet charge with irresistible force.
The British were obliged to give way at every point, losing two
hundred and thirty killed and wounded and about six hundred
prisoners. Tarleton escaped with difficulty. The Americans
lost only twelve
killed and sixty-one
wounded. The battle
of the Cowpens,
fought January 17,
1781, was the most
brilliant American
victory of the war, as
Camden had been the
most disastrous defeat.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s226'></a><span class='bold'>226. Morgan’s Race
with Cornwallis.</span>—Morgan,
having now
destroyed Tarleton’s
force, at once set out
to rejoin Greene, but,
in order to do so, he
had to run a race with
Cornwallis for the
fords of the Catawba
River. Though the British commander had the shorter course,
Morgan pushed on with so much greater speed that he was the
first to cross and thus was able to rejoin the main army.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s227'></a><span class='bold'>227. Battle of Guilford Court House.</span>—Greene now determined,
before fighting a decisive battle, to draw his enemies as far as
possible away from their supplies. Sending on a part of his
force in advance and placing himself in command of the rear,
he kept near enough to Cornwallis to lure him on without giving
him an opportunity for a decisive battle. At length, on February
9, the American forces united at Guilford Court House,
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
only about thirty miles south of the Virginia border, and here
Greene, after a delay of about one month, during which he received
reënforcements, selected ground for a battle. Though
the British had a smaller force, they were veterans, while
the larger part of Greene’s army was composed of recent
recruits. In the battle which occurred on the 15th of March,
the British had the advantage, but they lost so heavily that
Cornwallis did not dare to pursue the defeated army. In
order to reëstablish his communications with supplies, he
moved southeast for the port at Wilmington.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s228'></a><span class='bold'>228. Greene’s Recovery of the South.</span>—Greene followed him
rapidly until they were near the coast. Then Greene struck
into the South for the purpose of reëstablishing his authority
throughout the Carolinas. His march was not resisted with
any success. September 8, after a masterly campaign extending
over six months, he fought and won the last battle of the
series, at Eutaw Springs, about fifty miles from Charleston.
Thus, within little more than a year after the disastrous defeat
of Gates at Camden, the brilliant campaign of Greene drove
Cornwallis into Wilmington and the remaining British forces
in the South into Charleston, and had practically cleared the
intervening country of the enemy.</p>

<h3 id='s229a'>THE CLOSE OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s229'></a><span class='bold'>229. Movement of Cornwallis from Wilmington.</span>—Cornwallis,
however, did not long remain on the coast. As soon as he had
refreshed his army, he attempted, with the help of Arnold, to
overrun Virginia. Reaching Petersburg on the 20th of May,
he was able, within a short time, to take and pillage the more
important towns of Virginia, including Petersburg, Richmond,
Charlottesville, Portsmouth, and Williamsburg. To meet these
raiders, Washington sent Lafayette with an army of Americans
and French, amounting to about five thousand men. The
French commander, though only twenty-three years of age, had
learned from Washington the art of harassing the enemy without
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
bringing on a general engagement. Cornwallis now had a
little more than seven thousand men. After trying in vain to
bring Lafayette to battle, and to get reënforcements from Clinton,
he followed Clinton’s instructions by withdrawing his
force to Yorktown, in order to put himself in communication
with the British fleet. This was the fatal move that resulted
in the loss of the British cause.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s230'></a><span class='bold'>230. Plans of Washington and Rochambeau.</span>—Two days after
the British reached Petersburg, Washington had an important
conference with Rochambeau at Wethersfield, Connecticut.
There, it was decided to send to the West Indies for Commodore
de Grasse and such ships of the French fleet as could be
spared from that region. The purpose was to combine the
French and Americans,
either to make
a joint attack upon
New York, or, by a
sudden movement
toward the South,
to overwhelm Cornwallis.
De Grasse
was to choose and
to report whether
he would go to New
York, or would stop
at the Chesapeake.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/m10.jpg' alt='' id='m10' style='width:300px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Operations at Yorktown</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s231'></a><span class='bold'>231. Plan of the
Yorktown Campaign.</span>—In
due
time, Washington
learned that De
Grasse had chosen
the Southern destination, and accordingly he began at once
to maneuver his force so as to lead Clinton to suppose that
the purpose was a general attack on New York. He ordered
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
all preparations to be made in New Jersey as though he
intended a siege, even sending misleading dispatches, which
he planned to have the British capture. So skillfully was
this done, that even when the army began to move from the
Hudson, the British believed it was for the purpose of a
general attack upon the city from New Jersey and Staten
Island. The secret of the movement was confined to the French
and American commanders. Washington evidently believed
with Franklin, that three persons can keep a secret only when one
of them is dead. On the 19th of August, leaving a strong guard
along the front line, the French and American armies commenced
their Southern march. So skillfully had all plans been
arranged, that Clinton learned of the movement only after the
Americans had reached Philadelphia, nearly a hundred miles
away. He attempted a diversion by an attack upon Connecticut,
but it was impossible to retard the march, or distract
the attention of Washington. The British could not follow
without abandoning New York to Heath, who had been left
with four thousand men on the Hudson.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s232'></a><span class='bold'>232. Movement of De Grasse.</span>—De Grasse, with a larger fleet
even than had been anticipated, reached the Chesapeake on
the day when Washington reached Philadelphia. The French
admiral at once landed three thousand troops and turned them
over to Lafayette, whose army was thus increased to about
eight thousand men. The French general, knowing that
Washington was not far away, threw his lines boldly across
the peninsula, September 7, thus shutting Cornwallis completely
in. The British now saw the James on the one side,
the York River on the other, with De Grasse in the rear, and
Lafayette in front. Their condition was hopeless.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s233'></a><span class='bold'>233. Surrender of Cornwallis.</span>—Though a few British ships
reached the scene from the north, they were too weak to cope
with the fleet of De Grasse, and there was, therefore, no
possible escape. To break through the American lines was
impossible, as Cornwallis was now confronted by an army
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
more than twice the size of his own. The siege and bombardment
began at once. The cannonade was continued for some
days with terrific energy, till the British ammunition began
to fail. The outworks were carried by an assault in two
divisions,—one of Americans and the other of Frenchmen.
The Americans, led by Alexander Hamilton, were the first to
cross the British ramparts. This was on the 14th of October.
On the 17th, just four years after the surrender of Burgoyne,
Cornwallis hoisted the white flag. As soon as the preliminaries
could be settled, seven thousand two hundred and forty-seven
soldiers became prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s234'></a><span class='bold'>234. Influence of the Surrender on the British Government.</span>—The
surrender of Cornwallis was virtually the end of this long
and memorable contest, for it put enthusiastic life into the
Americans, while it overwhelmed the British government with
confusion. Those English statesmen who had opposed the war
from the first so strengthened their following that they were
able to sweep the king’s friends out of power and bring in a
government that sympathized with their views. The king himself,
though driven almost to despair by this stupendous event,
was the last to recognize its real significance; but at length
even George III. saw that with a war on his hands against
France, Spain, and Holland, his American project, so dear to
his heart, must now be given up. A new ministry, with Lord
Rockingham at its head, was brought in to negotiate terms of
peace.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s235'></a><span class='bold'>235. Difficulties in making Peace.</span>—There were long delays
and many difficulties in arranging terms. These were greatly
complicated by the fact that America had France as an ally,
and France had to be consulted in regard to all the conditions.
Congress had no money with which to pay off the soldiers,
and no power to raise money in the individual states. Discontent
among the rank and file threatened to end in the
most serious revolts. Nothing but the infallible tact and skill
of Washington prevented mutiny. The commander in chief,
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
however, was inflexible in his determination that the forces
should be kept up until the treaty was finally adopted. That
painful period of distress and waiting at length came to an
end, but it was not until September 3, 1783, nearly two years
after the surrender at Yorktown, that the treaty was signed
at Paris. By that act Great Britain acknowledged the independence
of the country from Canada to the Floridas, and
from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. The conquest of the
West was thus admitted, but the northern boundary was left
rather vague, owing to defective knowledge of the region.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s236'></a><span class='bold'>236. Treatment of Tories.</span>—The Americans made the mistake
of refusing to grant amnesty to the adherents of the defeated
party, as should always be done in civil war. The patriots, or
Whigs, as they were often called, continued to persecute the
Tories. Many were put to death, and thousands were obliged
to flee into Canada and Nova Scotia, where their descendants
still remember with bitterness the treatment of their ancestors.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s237'></a><span class='bold'>237. Causes of Success.</span>—The success of the Revolutionary
War was mainly due to five causes:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The unfailing courage, wisdom, and ability of Washington.
Even in the darkest hours his confidence in the final issue
never faltered. By the wisdom and persuasiveness of the
letters which he sent to governors, members of Congress, and
prominent men in all parts of the country, he inspired others
with something of his own confidence and multiplied the
friends of independence. His extraordinary military skill in
knowing when to fight and when not to fight, enabled him to
take advantage of the mistakes of the enemy and to strike a
blow whenever he could hurt the cause of the British or inspire
his own army with new courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The alliance and support of the French. Until the Yorktown
campaign the active assistance of the French in the field
was very slight, but the moral support was most important.
While it inspired the Americans with new courage, it had a
corresponding effect in disheartening the British, who had
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
to fight the French in other parts of the world. But for
De Grasse, the Yorktown campaign would probably not have
been attempted; for, if attempted, Cornwallis could easily
have been supported and relieved by the British fleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The weakness of the British commanders in the field.
Gage, Howe, Burgoyne, Clinton, and Cornwallis were all
greatly inferior to Washington and Greene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The British, toward the end of the conflict, had four
very important wars on their hands, so that they found it
impossible to send large reënforcements to their armies in
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. The persistent spirit of the American patriots. Though
often defeated, and sometimes much disheartened, they stubbornly
refused to give up. Even in the dark days of 1780,
when the South was overwhelmed and overrun, they never
regarded the cause as lost. It was this spirit which made it
possible for Washington to keep a force in the field large
enough to prevent the complete success of the British.</p>

<h3 id='s238a'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>DIFFICULTIES OF CONFEDERATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s238'></a><span class='bold'>238. Chaotic Condition at the Outbreak of the War.</span>—As soon
as the Declaration of Independence was adopted, the members
of Congress saw that some form of general government
would be necessary to bind the different parts of the country
into common methods. Several of the states now had the
advantage of regularly constituted governments; but the Continental
Congress was without authority from any source whatever.
Its members had been sent together by the different
states without any mutual understanding or instructions, and
consequently it had no power, except that of war, to enforce
its acts.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s239'></a><span class='bold'>239. Committee to frame Articles of Confederation.</span>—On the
day after the committee was appointed to frame the Declaration,
a still larger committee was charged with the duty
of preparing some plan of confederation. The difficulties met
by this committee were almost insurmountable. The colonies
were at that moment engaged in the work of framing permanent
constitutions for themselves. Nor did the common cause
of the war entirely sweep away the jealous differences between
the states. The colonies had been settled by people of differing
religious and political beliefs, and they had preferences for
differing methods. The smaller colonies feared they would be
absorbed, and the larger ones feared they would not have
proper representation. The same spirit which made them
desire to be free from the rule of the mother country made
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
each state unwilling to be subject to the rule of the other
states. As the Declaration of Independence had been aimed
against the central authority of Great Britain, it was natural
that they should distrust a strong central authority in the
government they were about to establish. It was in the face
of all these difficulties that the “Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union” were reported by the committee, only eight
days after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s240'></a><span class='bold'>240. Difficulties of Agreement.</span>—But the representatives
found so many reasons for desiring changes that a final agreement
was not reached by Congress until November of 1777.
Then the articles had to go to the several states for ratification.
The difficulties now seemed greater than ever before.
According to the articles, every state was to have an equal
vote with every other state, but to this equality of representation
the larger states very strongly objected, while the smaller
states stubbornly resisted every other method. There were
also grave differences of opinion as to the executive branch of
the new government.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s241'></a><span class='bold'>241. Western Lands.</span>—The ownership of the Western lands
was the occasion of one of the most serious difficulties. The
boundaries of some of the states were defined by their charters,
while those of others were not. Six of the states claimed to
extend as far west as the Mississippi River, while Virginia defined
her boundary as extending to the northwest so far as
to include the region which afterward formed Ohio, Michigan,
and Wisconsin. The other states held that this territory had
all been rescued from the British by common effort, and therefore
that it should belong to the nation as a whole. This
opinion finally prevailed. At length, after long and hot discussion,
New York agreed to cede its Western lands to the general
government, and this example was soon imitated by the
others, although several states still reserved certain portions
of their Western territory. After this concession, New Jersey
was the first state to ratify the articles. Others followed so
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
slowly that the ratification was not complete until Maryland
signed on March 1, 1781, only a few months before the surrender
at Yorktown. The delay shows the difficulty of obtaining
even so little central authority as the articles provided
for.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s242'></a><span class='bold'>242. Weaknesses of the Confederation.</span>—It immediately became
evident that the confederation had very serious defects.
Though a stronger government at the time could not have
been adopted, the one obtained was of little value, except to
show that a stronger government was demanded. By its provisions
no measure could be taken by Congress without the
vote of nine of the thirteen states, and even after the adoption
of a measure, the confederation had no power to enforce it.
The central government relied upon the individual states to
carry out its laws, and the states had the option of enforcing
obedience, or not, as they chose. Meantime the states themselves
were under no restrictions. They passed revenue laws
according to their own interests, and custom-houses had to be
multiplied along the state borders. Whenever any tax was
called for by Congress, to pay off the Continental troops or for
any other purpose, some of the states would enforce its collection
and others would not.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s243'></a><span class='bold'>243. Dangers shown by Shays’ Rebellion and Other Disturbances.</span>—In
New Hampshire an armed force assailed the
legislature at Exeter and demanded an issue of paper money.
In Massachusetts, the collection of debts and taxes was forcibly
resisted. The people in the central part of the state, led by
Daniel Shays, collected into a motley army, and not only attacked
the arsenal, but kept the state in a turmoil for more
than six months. At length “Shays’ Rebellion,” as it was
called, was put down by Governor Bowditch (1787), but with
difficulty. Not one of the insurgents was punished. The
states seemed to be growing farther and farther apart and
more and more independent. There was really great danger
that this tendency would go on till the United States, like
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
Europe, would be made up of many independent nationalities.
As if to make improvement impossible, the framers of the
Articles of Confederation had provided that no change in
them should be adopted unless agreed to by all the states.
The consequence was that whenever any change was proposed,
some state objected and the proposal was lost. It
was a time of such perplexity and danger that it has been
aptly called, “The Critical Period in American History.”</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Alexander Hamilton.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s244'></a><span class='bold'>244. First Effort for a Convention.</span>—During all this time
Washington, Hamilton, and Madison had been writing letters
to show that a change was necessary and to devise a means
of bringing it about. At length, the legislature of Virginia
issued a call in 1786 for a general convention to meet at Annapolis,
Maryland. But the smaller states were very shy of
committing themselves to any scheme proposed by any of the
larger states, and only five states responded to the call. Of
course nothing could be done. The very absence of representatives,
however, revealed some of the difficulties of the
situation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s245'></a><span class='bold'>245. Second Effort toward a Convention.</span>—The next year
another course was adopted and with greater success. The
call for the convention was issued by Congress. The purpose
of the call was not to frame a new constitution, but to
modify the old one. Twelve of the states appointed delegates,
Rhode Island, the smallest of the commonwealths, alone standing
aloof. The convention met at Philadelphia in May, 1787,
and unanimously chose Washington as its president.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s246'></a><span class='bold'>246. Ability in the Convention.</span>—This convention was fortunate
in having prominent representatives of all classes.
Every state sent its best. Of the fifty-five members, twenty-nine
had been college bred. Jefferson and John Adams were
in Europe. Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry opposed the
convention and remained at home. With these exceptions the
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
most eminent men of the country were present. Washington
and Franklin, by their general wisdom and great experience,
represented the
practical judgment of
men of affairs. There
were John Dickinson,
whose <span class='it'>Farmer’s Letters</span>
had done so much
to bring on the Revolution
(§ <a href='#s131'>131</a>), and
James Wilson, a
Scotchman, one of the
most learned jurists
the country has ever
had. Hamilton and
Madison, by their
varied and profound
knowledge of political
history, brought
to the convention the
advantage of the best
types of general scholarship.
Hamilton,<a id='r101'/><a href='#f101' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[101]</span></sup></a> though only thirty years of age, was probably
the ablest political thinker in the body. But his power was
neutralized by the fact that New York, the state which he
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
represented, had opposed the convention, and had sent two
delegates to do what they could to prevent success. Hamilton
was further handicapped
by the extreme
nature of his
views, for he believed
in a much
stronger central government
than could
at that time be
adopted.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/p183.jpg' alt='' id='p183' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>James Madison.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s247'></a><span class='bold'>247. James Madison.</span>—For
these
reasons, the main
guidance of the convention
fortunately
fell upon James
Madison,<a id='r102'/><a href='#f102' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[102]</span></sup></a> a young
man less brilliant
than Hamilton, but
superior to him in
the art of estimating
what is possible.
A graduate of
Princeton College, he had been from his youth a devoted
student of history, had made himself thoroughly acquainted
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
with all the best books on political science, and had paid
particular attention to the republican organizations of Greece,
Rome, Switzerland, and Holland. From the time he was
twenty-five he had taken a prominent part in the Virginia legislature
and in Congress, and he thoroughly understood the
weaknesses and difficulties of the Articles of Confederation.
His knowledge and experience, though united with a remarkable
firmness of purpose, were presented with a kindness and
sweetness of manner that commended his views to all his fellow-members.
Madison, therefore, was the most influential
of the members in giving the Constitution the form in which it
was adopted.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s248'></a><span class='bold'>248. General Spirit of the Convention.</span>—The delegates brought
together the wisdom and experience gained in framing the
state constitutions and from observing the prevailing difficulties.
The efforts of the convention to amend the Articles of
Confederation were doomed to early failure. It was soon decided
to abandon them altogether and to frame an entirely new
constitution. Here the smaller states caused the greatest difficulty,
for they were determined to give as little power as possible
to the general government, in order that they might not
be overwhelmed or absorbed. In this determination were
enlisted not only New York, which was then one of the less
important states, but also New Hampshire, New Jersey, Delaware,
and Maryland.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s249'></a><span class='bold'>249. Representation of Slaves.</span>—Another very serious obstacle
was presented by the slave trade and the question of the
representation of slaves in Congress. In the early part of the
eighteenth century there were about twelve thousand slaves
north of Mason and Dixon’s line, and about forty-eight
thousand south of it. But at the time of the Constitutional
Convention, there were about fifty thousand in the North,
and not far from seven hundred thousand in the South.
There had been little or no importation of slaves during
the war, and the slave system was generally condemned by
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
the best men of the South as well as by those of the North.
In their opinion, it was only a question of time when it
would cease altogether. But the greater number of slaves in
the South made the Southern delegates determined to have
them represented, while the North generally opposed such
representation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s250'></a><span class='bold'>250. Strength of Central Government.</span>—Another difficulty in
the way of agreement was found in the radical differences of
opinion between the members as to whether the new government
was to be very weak or very strong. This was by far the most
important question of all. One party held that the states
should still be left with great powers, and should be practically
independent; while the opposite party thought that a
general government with the essential attributes of an elective
monarchy was most needed. There was, however, a very
general and a very natural remembrance of the fact that it
was the predominating strength of the executive part of the
British government that had caused separation, and there was
a general disposition to avoid any similar defect.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s251'></a><span class='bold'>251. Discussion of the Difficulties.</span>—These various difficulties
taxed all the faculties of the members. It sometimes seemed
that not another step of progress could be made, and that the
delegates would be obliged to abandon the task and go home.
As discussion advanced, it became evident that no agreement
could be made except through a general spirit of conciliation
and compromise. The convention sat with closed doors, and
for four months considered the stupendous difficulties that
confronted them. At length, on the 17th day of September,
1787, they agreed upon a constitution and adjourned. It
was to go into effect when ratified by the conventions of nine
states.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s252'></a><span class='bold'>252. Four Great Lines of Compromise.</span>—The Constitution was
built upon a basis of four great lines of mutual concession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the smaller states were brought to agreement by
being allowed the same representation in the Senate as the
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
larger states; while the larger states were satisfied by being
allowed to send to the House of Representatives a number
of delegates to be determined by the number of inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second, the question of the representation of slavery in
Congress was finally adjusted by providing that for determining
the number of representatives of each state, Congress
should add to the number of freemen three-fifths of all
persons held to service. Congress was also prohibited from
abolishing the foreign slave trade before 1808.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, the advocates of a strong central government came
to an agreement with the advocates of a weak one by allowing
the dividing line between the authority of the central government
and of the several states to be somewhat vaguely defined,
and by leaving such definition to the course of future events.
It is probable that if either side had insisted on putting
into words a statement authorizing its interpretation, no
agreement could have been reached. This uncertainty of
interpretation, though apparently necessary to an agreement
on the Constitution, might be called the fundamental cause of
the Civil War in 1861.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourth, while the President, by being made commander in
chief of the army and being intrusted with the enforcement
of all laws, was given great authority, he was put under
rigid constitutional checks in numerous ways. In case he
should exceed his authority, he could be impeached by the
House of Representatives and tried by the Senate; and in
case of conviction, removed from office. It was further provided
that in all cases whatsoever involving differences of
opinion regarding the Constitution, the Supreme Court should
render authoritative decision. This authority of the Supreme
Court was the most marked peculiarity of the Constitution.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Federal Hall, New York City.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s253'></a><span class='bold'>253. Characteristics of the Constitution.</span>—On the basis of
these mutual concessions, the Constitution was finally adopted.
It provided for three departments of government: the Legislative,
to make the laws; the Executive, to execute the laws;
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
and the Judicial, to define the laws in case of dispute. The
legislature consisted of the House of Representatives, the
members of which were to be chosen for two years by
the people of the several states; and the Senate, consisting of
two members from each state, who were to be chosen for a term
of six years. The executive officer was to be a President,
elected for a term of four years, by electors chosen by the
people of the several states, each state to have as many
electors as it had members in the Senate and the House
of Representatives together. To the President was also given
legislative influence through the right of veto. The judiciary
was to consist of a Supreme Court, and such other courts as
Congress might provide for. The judges were to be appointed
by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and were
to hold office during good behavior. In case of misdemeanor
they could be removed by impeachment. The authority given
to the Supreme Court to declare acts of Congress contrary to
the Constitution, and therefore null and void, was a new
element in government and made the court stronger than
any other court in existence. Jefferson returned from Europe
just after the completion of the work of the convention, and
was almost panic stricken by fear that the plan of government,
if adopted by the states, would allow, if not even
encourage, the establishment of monarchy. It was many
years before Jefferson’s fears were allayed. The general wisdom
of these provisions, however, has been acknowledged by
the whole world.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s254'></a><span class='bold'>254. Attitude of the States.</span>—After the adoption of the Constitution
by the convention, it went to the several states for
ratification, and during the winter of 1787–1788 conventions in
the respective commonwealths had the question of adoption
under consideration. Its ratification was most strenuously
opposed in Virginia, in New York, and in Rhode Island.
Patrick Henry was the most eloquent of these opponents, his
opposition being founded on the belief that the general government
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
would gradually grow so strong as to interfere with the
governments of the individual states. Of the states unfavorable
to the Constitution, New Hampshire was the first to yield,
in June, 1788. New York and Virginia soon followed. Rhode
Island and North Carolina held out, and the Constitution went
into effect without their consent. In order to satisfy those
who thought the Federal government had too much power, ten
amendments to the Constitution, embodying a Bill of Rights
designed to restrict those powers, were adopted in 1791. The
final adoption of the Constitution was brought about very
largely through the influence of a remarkable series of letters
written by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, and afterward collected
into the volume
known as <span class='it'>The Federalist</span>.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s255'></a><span class='bold'>255. Washington, the
First President.</span>—When,
soon after the adoption of
the Constitution, the first
general election was held,
it was found that every
elector voted for Washington,
who was therefore
unanimously elected as
the first President. John
Adams, having the next
number of votes, was elected Vice President. On April 30,
1789, they were inaugurated on the balcony of the Federal
Building, on Wall Street, New York City, which was then the
seat of government.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s256'></a><span class='bold'>256. Ordinance for governing the Northwest.</span>—While the
Constitutional Convention was in session at Philadelphia, the
Congress of the Confederation was in session in New York City.
On the 30th of July, 1787, Congress passed the memorable
“Ordinance for the Organization of Government in the Northwest,”
that vast and important territory which now comprises
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
a part of Minnesota. This ordinance established among others
four provisions of fundamental importance, which have contributed
immensely to the development of the North Central
states. These four fundamental provisions were the following:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. “Slavery and involuntary servitude shall forever be
excluded.” This provision exempted the region from those
perplexing discussions which afterward troubled Missouri,
Kansas, and Nebraska.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. “Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary for
the welfare of mankind, schools and the means of education
shall forever be encouraged.” In this provision common
schools, high schools, normal schools, and universities found
their constitutional justification, and accordingly, in all the
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
states formed from the Northwest Territory, schools of all
grades have been supported by taxation. The example thus
set has been followed by all the states since admitted to the
Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. “The navigable rivers leading into the Mississippi and
the St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between them, shall
be common highways and forever free.” This provision secured
that freedom of communication between the states which has
encouraged very rapid material growth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. “The inhabitants shall forever enjoy religious freedom,
the habeas corpus, trial by jury, and equal civil and political
privileges.” This provision not only secured perfect independence
of religious thought, but protected all the people, immigrants
as well as others, in the enjoyment of political freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the binding authority of this ordinance was
subsequently declared by the Supreme Court to have been
superseded by the adoption of the Constitution, its influence on
the development of the Northwest was unquestionably very
great.</p>

<h3 id='s257a'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>GENERAL CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s257'></a><span class='bold'>257. Population and Area.</span>—The country over which Washington
began to preside in 1789 was very different from the great
nation it has grown to be. Counting about seven hundred and
fifty thousand slaves, the population did not quite reach four
millions. Eleven years later, by the second census, that of 1800,
this population had increased to 5,308,480; but the area of
827,844 square miles was not yet settled at the ratio of six and a
half persons to a square mile. It was only along the Atlantic
coast from Virginia to Massachusetts that the original wilderness
had been fairly conquered by settlements that furnished a
population of from twenty-five to ninety inhabitants to the
square mile.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s258'></a><span class='bold'>258. Boundary Disputes.</span>—The boundaries of this immense
and practically unoccupied area were in dispute to the north,
northwest, and south. The British still kept garrisons at
Detroit, Niagara, and other forts. In the region bordering on
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
the Gulf of Mexico, Spanish claims conflicted with those of the
Americans, and Spain denied the inhabitants of the new settlements
beyond the Alleghanies any practical use of the lower
Mississippi. A treaty with Spain in 1795 helped to mend
these matters.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Blockhouse at Mackinaw,<br/> 1780.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s259'></a><span class='bold'>259. The West.</span>—The Westerners, who were thus deprived
of the full use of their great waterway and whom Spanish
agents endeavored to detach from the Union, were few in
numbers. Kentucky and Tennessee were practically the only
organized settlements; but a popular movement toward Ohio
and the Northwest was beginning, and by the end of the century
the Mississippi Territory had
been formed in the region which
Georgia claimed north of the Gulf.
Most of the settlers in these outlying
communities had moved westward
from the frontier portions of
the adjoining older states. Thus
many of the immigrants to Tennessee
came from North Carolina.
Often they were of Scotch-Irish
stock, deeply religious, hardy and
frugal. They drove out the Indians,
killed the wild beasts, cleared lands for their farms, and raised
their large families in a rude independence. On the foundations
they laid, great commonwealths have been erected which should
not in their present wealth and power forget the bold adventurers
who crossed the mountains in wagon trains or floated
down the Ohio in large flat-bottomed boats.<a id='r103'/><a href='#f103' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[103]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s260'></a><span class='bold'>260. The Older Commonwealths.</span>—Within the original colonies
state lines were much confused. Vermont did not formally
succeed in throwing off New York’s claim and becoming a
state until 1791. Connecticut still claimed a strip of land
along the northern border of the Northwest Territory. Maine
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
continued to constitute a district of Massachusetts. The
population of all the states was chiefly of English descent and
was, on the whole, homogeneous, although the amount of intercourse
between state and state was still small. Virginia was
the most populous of the states, Massachusetts ranking next.
Each was typical of the region to which it belonged, the presence
of slavery more or less retarding the South, and the comparative
absence of it favoring New England.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s261'></a><span class='bold'>261. Occupations.</span>—Although the country had grown considerably
in population and wealth during the eighteenth century,
the people had not greatly changed in character or in their
pursuits. The confusion engendered by the Revolution was
slowly passing away, but the revived industries ran along
much the same narrow lines as of old. At Washington’s
accession to the Presidency public and private finances were in
a bad shape, but speedy improvement followed the reforms
of Hamilton, shortly to be described (§ <a href='#s266'>266</a>). Agriculture
was still the main calling—the nation being, on the whole,
one of farmers. Commerce, however, was a surer source of
wealth, especially in the East, where there was a good deal of
shipping. But manufacturing was in its infancy, as we at
once perceive when we learn that even in 1800 not quite four
per cent of the people lived in towns.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s262'></a><span class='bold'>262. The Towns.</span>—The country people had no such incentives
to flock to cities as they have to-day. There were no
railroads or steamboats to make the journey easy. On the
contrary, roads were bad and travel by water was both uncomfortable
and dangerous. Nor were the towns, of which Philadelphia
with seventy thousand inhabitants, New York with
sixty thousand, Baltimore with twenty-six thousand, Boston
with twenty-four thousand, and Charleston with twenty thousand,
were the chief, especially attractive. Sanitation was
little attended to, save in Philadelphia after the terrible yellow
fever epidemics of 1793 and 1797. There were few theaters.
The newspapers were small and uninfluential sheets. Good
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
colleges and schools and libraries were scarcely to be found.
Life was comparatively simple and lacking in interest and
brilliancy. Indeed the country gentleman, especially in the
South, found his rural sports and his rounds of social visiting
more enlivening than the life led by his town friends.</p>

<h3 id='s263a'>SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s263'></a><span class='bold'>263. Dominance of the Colonial Spirit.</span>—In their mental attitude
toward life the American people had changed about as
little as in their occupations and customs. Although in
Jonathan Edwards and Benjamin Franklin they had produced
two great writers, in Franklin and Benjamin Thompson
(Count Rumford, 1733–1814) eminent scientists, and in Benjamin
West (1738–1820) and J. S. Copley (1737–1815) distinguished
painters; although they had developed as great
statesmen and political writers as any country could name,
they still had no literature, or art, or science worthy of being
called national. In other words, though the people of the
United States had won their political independence, they were
still, in their modes of thought and action, dominated by the
spirit of colonial dependence. There were many persons
who not merely imitated English manners and dress, read
English books, and wrote in the current English style, but
who even shared, in the main, English political ideas and prejudices.
There were others who were fully as much influenced
by French modes of thought and life. Here and there, in
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
great men like Washington or Franklin, we find a sturdy
originality that smacks of the soil, and undoubtedly the plainer
people were little affected by foreign ideas and customs. But
the towns still preserved their colonial attitude of dependence
on Europe, and this was in the main true of the prosperous
country families as well. In fact, the seaboard colonies were,
in a way, outskirts of Europe, just as the Western communities
were outskirts of the Atlantic seaboard. There was little of
the enterprise and activity which throughout America to-day
keep small communities from stagnating. In short, our forefathers
of three generations ago were in many ways a very
different race of beings from their descendants of to-day.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s264'></a><span class='bold'>264. Virtue and Happiness of the People.</span>—Yet it would be
a great mistake to suppose that the drawbacks just enumerated
were in the main apparent to the American people themselves,
or that they are greatly to be insisted upon in a sketch of the
civilization of the period. American life might at the close of
the eighteenth century seem dull and narrow to travelers from
Europe, but we know that a happy, brave, free, religious people
inhabited a land that yielded abundant returns to their labors,
and we may readily believe that their lives were fully as useful
as ours are to-day. Nor should it ever be forgotten that amid
these provincial surroundings arose the greatest figure that
modern history can show, and that the American people were
wise enough to choose electors who would make him President.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XIII.<br/> <span class='bold'><span class='sc'>the administrations of washington, 1789–1797.</span></span></h2>

<h3 id='s265a'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>EARLY LEGISLATION AND PARTIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s265'></a><span class='bold'>265. Washington as a Statesman.</span>—When Washington took
the oath of office in New York City<a id='r104'/><a href='#f104' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[104]</span></sup></a> on April 30, 1789, few people
could have foreseen that the elderly, dignified man, dressed
in the picturesque costume of the period, would one day rank
among the greatest statesmen of the world. His experience
had been rather with military than with civil affairs. He was
reserved in temper, and liked forms and ceremonies to which
the masses were opposed. He had few of the arts of persuasion.
His mind was not trained like that of John Adams,
for example, nor was it markedly original. But he had
had the training of experience, and he had what is essential
to statesmanship of the first order—a great character,
sobriety, dignity, perfect rectitude of purpose, knowledge of
men, and willingness to trust those whom he regarded as competent—in
short, wisdom as opposed to mere knowledge
made Washington the great statesman we now know him to
have been. He held the reins of government firmly and made
few or no mistakes. He saw that the new nation should
show prudence and by its dignity win the respect of other
nations; and in spite of criticism, and often of frantic opposition,
he kept his administrations well in line with his ideals.
He avoided foreign complications and appeased or put down
domestic discontent. He balanced political parties and made
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
their leaders serve the state. When he laid down his office
he explained his principles in his “Farewell Address,” which
has become one of the political classics of the world. And
now, after the lapse of a century, the perspective of time enables
us to comprehend, in part at least, the unique grandeur
of his position among men.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s266'></a><span class='bold'>266. Early Legislation.</span>—The first Congress, which was organized
shortly before Washington was inaugurated, contained
some eminent men, chief among them perhaps being James
Madison of Virginia, in the House of Representatives, and
John Adams of Massachusetts, who, as Vice President, presided
over the Senate. The members were residents of the districts
they represented, and their salary was at first six dollars a day.
The most important work they did, after determining the rules
of procedure that should govern them, was to organize those
portions of the administration and government that had been
left vague by the Constitution. They established the three departments
of State, Treasury, and War, whose Secretaries, along
with the Attorney-General, formed the President’s Cabinet.<a id='r105'/><a href='#f105' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[105]</span></sup></a>
The Post-Office Department was also organized, but the Postmaster-General
was not then included in the Cabinet. Congress
furthermore organized the Federal judiciary along the
lines of circuit and district courts that it follows at present,
the Supreme Court having been authorized by the Constitution,
but the number of its justices not having been settled.
They also passed a tariff law giving mild protection to manufacturers,
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
as well as a moderate system of internal duties on
distilled spirits. They arranged for the payment of the
foreign and domestic public debt of the United States, about
fifty-four million dollars, mainly incurred to carry on the Revolution,
and also, after much discussion, agreed to assume a
large part, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> twenty-one million five hundred thousand
dollars, of the debts of the individual states contracted for
the same purpose. The latter measure was carried only by
means of an agreement to fix the Federal capital at a point
on the Potomac River (afterward Washington), in return for
which concession Southern votes were secured.<a id='r106'/><a href='#f106' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[106]</span></sup></a> Finally,
Congress established a National Bank with a capital of ten
million dollars and a charter running twenty years, and also
laid before the states twelve amendments to the Constitution
which, as we have seen (§ <a href='#s254'>254</a>), had been suggested during the
state debates on the adoption of that instrument.<a id='r107'/><a href='#f107' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[107]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s267'></a><span class='bold'>267. Hamilton and the Federalists.</span>—The financial legislation
mentioned in the last paragraph had been outlined in the main
by Alexander Hamilton of New York, the first Secretary of
the Treasury. This remarkable man had distinguished himself
as a soldier and as a contributor to <span class='it'>The Federalist</span> in
defense of the Constitution (§ <a href='#s254'>254</a>), before Washington chose
him as his chief counselor. As a financier and an administrator
working under a chief, he has probably had no equal in
America. In his theories of government, however, he favored
a strong central administration more than a simple people suspicious
of tyranny thought proper. Hence, while he easily
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
dominated all the supporters of the new government, he failed
to secure the confidence of the masses and probably would not
have been given the Presidency, even if he had not fallen in a
duel with Aaron Burr in 1804. He did, however, during his
life direct the policy of the Federalists, as the party supporting
the Union under the Constitution was called. Washington
would have liked to govern without parties, but the unsettled
question whether the new central government should be strong
or weak necessitated a twofold division of voters. And in the
end even Washington was forced more or less to take sides
with Hamilton and the Federalists.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s268'></a><span class='bold'>268. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans.</span>—Hamilton’s
rival in the Cabinet was Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, who
gave up his post as minister to France to accept the Secretaryship
of State. Jefferson had already acquired great fame as the
writer of the Declaration of Independence and other state papers.
He had been governor of Virginia, and was a good legislator
and administrative officer, although plainly Hamilton’s
inferior in the latter respect. But he was especially strong in
his thorough comprehension of the desires of the people and in
his ability to criticise political institutions and measures. He
believed in democracy and wished government to be simple in
every respect. Being suspicious by nature, he thought that
Hamilton and the Federalists were aiming to establish a strong
republic that might develop into a monarchy. In order to
oppose them, he drew together all the dissatisfied elements in
the country, as well as all the advocates of a simple, popular
government, into a party soon known as the Democratic-Republicans.
Under one name or another, the two parties formed
under Hamilton and Jefferson have existed to our own day.
The two Secretaries naturally opposed each other in the Cabinet,<a id='r108'/><a href='#f108' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[108]</span></sup></a>
and Washington had a hard task in forcing them to work
together. Finally Jefferson, who had indiscreetly used the
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
newspapers against the administration, desired to resign and
return to his home at Monticello,<a id='r109'/><a href='#f109' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[109]</span></sup></a> and Washington let him go.
After this, as we have just seen, the President allowed Hamilton
more and more power, and the administration became practically
a Federalist one, although its head was still superior to
mere party considerations.</p>

<h3 id='s269a'>DIFFICULTIES OF ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s269'></a><span class='bold'>269. Washington’s First Term.</span>—At the appointed time, before
the expiration of his first term, Washington was elected
unanimously for a second. During his first term, in which
North Carolina and Rhode Island were reconciled to the Union,
and Vermont and Kentucky added to it, only two events of
great importance took place. These were St. Clair’s defeat
and the outbreak of the French Revolution. This latter event
was destined to complicate domestic politics in America after
Washington had begun his second administration.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s270'></a><span class='bold'>270. St. Clair’s Defeat.</span>—The Northwestern Indians had
been giving trouble since 1786, and in 1791 had destroyed
the settlement of Big Bottom, in Ohio. In order to check
them, it was determined to construct a line of forts from
Cincinnati to Lake Michigan. General Arthur St. Clair, governor
of the Northwest Territory, was beginning the work
when he was entrapped in ambush, and suffered a crushing
defeat (1791). He resigned, and Washington, who was moved
to indignation and grief by the catastrophe, appointed “Mad
Anthony” Wayne, another Revolutionary veteran, as his successor
(§ <a href='#s198'>198</a>). Wayne, a thorough soldier, proceeded cautiously,
and two years later (1793) broke the power of the
tribes in a battle near Vincennes. The treaty of Greenville
(1795) relieved eastern Ohio from Indian menaces.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s271'></a><span class='bold'>271. Genet’s Indiscretions.</span>—Early in 1793 war was declared
between France and England, and the Democratic-Republican
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
party wished to involve America in the struggle, directly or
indirectly, in the interests of her former ally. We had a
treaty binding us to defend French colonies, like those in the
West Indies, but this treaty had been concluded with the
French monarchy, not with the Republic that had overthrown
Louis XVI. After some discussion in the Cabinet, Washington
issued a proclamation of strict neutrality, which naturally
disappointed the French revolutionists greatly. Their minister
to America, Edmond Charles Genet, landed in Charleston
and began to fit out privateers and enlist men in plain defiance
of the President’s proclamation. He counted on the sympathy
of the people with France, and was, indeed, received with enthusiasm
by many visionary citizens. But Washington stopped
his privateers, and treated all his demands with such firmness
that he soon lost ground. He had the insolence to make a
public appeal against the administration. This foolhardy act
could lead to but one result—his recall, at the request of the
United States. Genet, however, though recalled, chose not to
run the risk of returning to France, where the guillotine was in
full operation.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>John Jay.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s272'></a><span class='bold'>272. Jay’s Treaty.</span>—One of the chief events of Washington’s
second administration was the ratification of the treaty
with Great Britain, which bears the name of the statesman
who negotiated it—John Jay,<a id='r110'/><a href='#f110' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[110]</span></sup></a> then Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. There were various restrictions placed by
England upon America’s trade, and the ships of the latter
were being captured during the war then in progress between
Great Britain and France. Native-born Americans were frequently
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
taken from the decks of their country’s merchant
vessels and pressed into the British naval service, on the
pretense that they were really British born. As the two nations
spoke the same language, it was often difficult to prove that
this impressment was illegal. There were other troubles, connected
with the failure
of the British
to abandon frontier
posts, with boundary
disputes, and with
unpaid claims; hence
there was much popular
feeling against
Great Britain. Jay,
after great trouble,
negotiated in the
autumn of 1794 a
treaty which removed
some grievances, such
as the unlawful occupation
by the British
of military posts upon
American soil, but did
not much improve the
condition of trade, nor
abate the impressment
nuisance. Washington, although he was disappointed, thought
that even such a treaty for twelve years would be better than a
war with England. He called an extra session of the Senate in
June, 1795, and after a hot debate, the treaty, slightly altered,
was confirmed. There was great popular displeasure about the
matter, and Jay and Washington were bitterly reviled, but in
the end it was seen that they had acted wisely.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s273'></a><span class='bold'>273. The Whisky Rebellion.</span>—Another event of importance
was an insurrection in western Pennsylvania in the summer
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
and autumn of 1794, commonly known as “The Whisky
Rebellion.” The moderate excise tax on whisky had outraged
the rough frontiersmen of the district, since they made the
liquor easily and could purchase goods in exchange for it.<a id='r111'/><a href='#f111' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[111]</span></sup></a>
They threatened the tax collectors in mobs, and finally blood
was shed, in July, 1794. Great excitement followed, and the
government mail was robbed. Then the President called out
the militia from Pennsylvania and neighboring states, and fifteen
thousand men were marched over the region, encountering
no opposition, and making only a few arrests. Two rough
fellows were convicted of treason, but Washington pardoned
them, and the insurrection was at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s274'></a><span class='bold'>274. Washington Refuses a Third Term.</span>—In 1796, in his
famous “Farewell Address,” Washington declined reëlection
for a third term, thus setting a precedent which has been followed
ever since. He served his country from the spring of
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
1789 to that of 1797. During his second term his political
assailants were especially venomous.<a id='r112'/><a href='#f112' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[112]</span></sup></a> As criticism hurt him
sorely, he was glad to lay down his office, and retire to Mount
Vernon, particularly as it seemed that the new government
was now stable enough to be able to exist without him.</p>

General Henry Knox of Massachusetts was the first Secretary of War and
was also intrusted with the charge of naval affairs. The Navy Department
was not established until 1798. Edmund Randolph of Virginia was the first
Attorney-General. The two most important secretaryships were those of
State and of Treasury respectively (§§ <a href='#s267'>267</a>, <a href='#s268'>268</a>). The Cabinet officers did
not obtain the privilege of appearing before Congress in order to explain and
defend the measures advocated by them. Thus an important variation from
British parliamentary government was introduced. Another variation has
come about through the fact that the Speaker of the House, who was at first
an impartial moderator, has become for three quarters of a century the most
influential of party leaders through his privilege of appointing all committees.</p>

Of these twelve proposed amendments, ten were ratified in 1791. They
form a Bill of Rights. A few years later an eleventh was added in order to
prevent states from being sued by citizens, and a twelfth, as we shall soon see,
in order to avoid deadlocks in the election of a President. At this point the
practice of amending the Constitution stopped until after the Civil War.
Cumbrous formalities had to be gone through, and it was soon found that the
decisions of the Supreme Court in constitutional questions were the best means
of making the Constitution a flexible instrument capable of adapting itself to
the changing needs of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s275'></a><span class='bold'>275. The Election of John Adams.</span>—Washington’s refusal of
a third term and retirement to Mount Vernon, brought John
Adams<a id='r113'/><a href='#f113' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[113]</span></sup></a> to the front
as the natural choice
of the Federalists for
President. Hamilton,
as we have seen (§ <a href='#s267'>267</a>),
was out of the question,
and the services of
Massachusetts’ great
son during the Revolution
ranked next to
those of Washington
now that Franklin was
dead. The Democratic-Republicans
naturally
favored Jefferson; but
there was no such
elaborate campaign
between the rivals as
there is in our day.
As the electoral system
then stood, the
person receiving the highest number of votes in the Electoral
College became President, the person receiving the next highest
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
number, Vice President. Hamilton tried by an intrigue to get
Thomas Pinckney, of South Carolina, who was the Federalist
candidate for Vice President, elected President over Adams.
His scheme failed, however, for Pennsylvania and the South
voted for Jefferson, who thus secured 69 votes to Adams’s 71.
Jefferson, therefore, became Vice President. Congress divided,
the Senate continuing Federalist, but both parties being so
nearly even in the House that a few moderate Democratic-Republicans
held the balance of power.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s276'></a><span class='bold'>276. The X. Y. Z. Affair.</span>—Adams took over Washington’s
Cabinet, from which Hamilton had retired in 1795. In so doing
he made a mistake, since the Secretaries regarded Hamilton as
the leader of their party, and indulged in intrigues against
their lawful chief. The new President also tried to carry out
Washington’s general policy, and found himself hampered,
especially with regard to France. The French had not liked
the treaty the United States had concluded with their enemies,
the British, through the diplomacy of Jay, and they had been
imprudently dealt with by the American minister, James
Monroe. Monroe’s successor, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney<a id='r114'/><a href='#f114' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[114]</span></sup></a> of
South Carolina, was not well treated in France, and at once informed
Adams that the French Directory would not receive
another Minister from the United States until their grievances
were redressed. Adams immediately called a special session of
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
Congress, but was wise enough to send over John Marshall of
Virginia and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts to act with Pinckney
as commissioners.
Nearly a year later
news was received
that an attempt had
been made to make
the commissioners,
who had not been
officially received,
offer money for securing
a settlement of
the trouble. In other
words, American envoys
had been told
that they must commit
the crime of bribery
if they wished
to serve their country
effectively. The
names of the persons
making these insulting
demands were
veiled under the letters X. Y. Z.—hence the matter is known as
the X. Y. Z. Affair. Adams and the people at large resented
this treatment of the commissioners, and a war with France
was imminent. Indeed in July, 1798, American vessels of war
were authorized to attack French men-of-war, and a French
frigate was actually taken in February, 1799. Washington
was made commander in chief of the land forces with Hamilton
as second in command, but neither had occasion to serve
actively.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s277'></a><span class='bold'>277. The Alien and Sedition Laws.</span>—Meanwhile Adams and the
Federalists, who had the sympathy of the country in the impending
war, speedily lost it by passing the famous “Alien and
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
Sedition Laws.” The editors of the Republican press, being
in many cases foreign-born, had been friendly to France since
the days of the French Revolution and of Genet’s mission, and
had attacked Adams and his party violently. The Federalists,
believing that the liberties of the country would be destroyed
if this license were not checked, not only passed a rigid naturalization
law, but also one providing for the removal from the
country of dangerous aliens designated by the President.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s278'></a><span class='bold'>278. Features of the Sedition Law.</span>—To this act against
foreigners, which was tyrannical in theory although not in
practice, an even worse law was added relative to sedition. It
was designed to punish persons who conspired in order to resist
the government’s measures or to intimidate officeholders. It
was also aimed at persons guilty of libeling the government,
Congress, or the President. Practically this was to gag the
press in the interest of the Federalist party. The first conspicuously
effective use of the law was made against an obnoxious
Republican editor named Callender. But the journalists
took shelter behind public opinion, and the Federalists soon
found to their sorrow that they had gone too far in their attack
on popular liberties.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s279'></a><span class='bold'>279. The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions.</span>—Jefferson led
the resistance to the unpopular law, and as he could hope to do
nothing with Congress until a new election, he turned to the
state legislatures. In those of Virginia and Kentucky, in the
fall of 1798, resolutions were adopted, since known as the Virginia
and Kentucky Resolutions. These declared that, as the
Constitution was a compact between the states, the latter have
individually the right to pass judgment upon the enactments
of the general government, which derives its power to make laws
from the Constitution. In pursuance of this assumed right the
legislatures representing the two states pronounced the Alien
and Sedition Acts unconstitutional and void and called on other
states to do likewise. In 1799 the Kentucky legislature passed
a second series, which declared that all acts of the general
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
government unauthorized by the Constitution ought to be nullified
by the states. The immediate object and effect of these
resolutions was to render the Alien and Sedition Laws unpopular
and suspected. The chief effect, however, was seen later to lie
in the support given by the names of Madison and Jefferson,
authors respectively of the Virginia and Kentucky series, to
the theory of the “compact” origin of the government and to
the subsequent Carolina doctrine of nullification.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s280'></a><span class='bold'>280. Dissensions in the Cabinet.</span>—While the Federalists
were defeating themselves by the laws they passed, Adams was
dividing them by his policy. In order to conclude a new treaty
with France, he nominated a minister to that country without
consulting his Cabinet. This not only alienated his Secretaries
still more, but also irritated those Federalists who had wished
to fight France. Relations became so strained in the Cabinet
that Timothy Pickering, a friend of Hamilton’s, had to be replaced,
as Secretary of State, by John Marshall. But Adams
secured his treaty (1800) through a commission of three, instead
of through the Minister he had at first nominated.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s281'></a><span class='bold'>281. The Presidential Election of 1800.</span>—As a new election
was approaching, Hamilton again tried to oust Adams as
leader of the Federalists, but failed. Adams, with C. C. Pinckney
for a colleague, received the votes of the Federalist electors
but was defeated by Jefferson by eight votes (seventy-three to
sixty-five). Unfortunately, however, Aaron Burr, the New
York Democratic-Republican, who was supported for Vice President,
got the same number of votes as Jefferson, which threw the
election into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists
had a majority. There was great confusion, and for a time it
looked as if Burr, who was thought to be unprincipled, would
be chosen. It was even believed by some persons that the
Federalists would be able to keep themselves in power on the
plea that old officials must hold over until new ones were legally
elected. But Hamilton at last supported Jefferson, as the lesser
of two evils, and through the votes of moderate Federalist congressmen,
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
like James A. Bayard of Delaware, the Virginia
statesman was elected. This solution of the problem was most
fortunate, as Jefferson was plainly the choice of the people,
and as civil war might have followed a successful plot to deprive
him of the Presidency. As a result of the complication, the
Twelfth Amendment was adopted in 1804, making it incumbent
upon electors to vote specifically for a President and a
Vice President. Just before retiring from office, in March, 1801,
Adams made a number of appointments to office, known as the
“midnight appointments.” These, as we shall see, caused
Jefferson much vexation. It was not altogether fair for
Adams thus to hamper his successor, nor should the Federalist
President have shown his vexation at the result of the
election by driving out of Washington early in the morning of
March 4 in order not to be obliged to attend Jefferson’s inauguration.
Adams and the Federalists generally believed, however,
that Jefferson and the Republicans would begin a reign of
anarchy, and some allowance must be made for what was,
nevertheless, an act of great discourtesy. It is pleasant to add
that the strained relations between the two statesmen were
entirely mended before their deaths.</p>

<h3 id='s282a'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>JEFFERSONIAN POLICY.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s282'></a><span class='bold'>282. Jefferson’s Character and General Policy.</span>—With the advent
of the popular Jefferson as President, the aristocratic Federalists,
especially those of New England, thought, as we have just
seen, that anarchy would ensue. Jefferson was supposed to be an
opponent of all social distinctions, of strong organized government,
and even of religious institutions. As a matter of fact,
he was a widely cultured country gentleman who had liberal
political theories, a sympathy with the masses of the people,
especially the agriculturists, and a profound belief in human
capacity for progress. He was too suspicious, and he often
lacked dignity; he had no great executive ability and preferred
rather to manage than to command, but he understood the American
people as perhaps no other man has done. Furthermore,
he gave in his writings the most subtle and widely current
exposition of general republican ideas that has ever been given.
He corresponded with leading men throughout the country and
by his letters molded public opinion. His accession to power,
so far from overthrowing the government, gave it a popular
support it could have received in no other way; and the
successive elections of his pupils, Madison and Monroe, kept
the South and West fairly in the Union until the central government
became strong enough under Jackson to crush incipient
efforts to divide the nation. None of these three Virginian
Presidents was a commanding man, but all were influential,
and their policies made for harmony. Hence the period of
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
their administrations had an importance not at first perceived.
They helped to hold the agricultural slave-holding South in
line with the manufacturing and commercial North and East.
They made mistakes, were embarrassed by foreign complications
and domestic difficulties, and had to persuade instead of
rule. But they represented both the Union and the section
that was most masterful and restive of control, and thus
their administrations formed a necessary stage in the nation’s
evolution.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s283'></a><span class='bold'>283. The Revolution of 1801.</span>—Another point to be remembered
about these Presidents is the fact that they were all representative
of the educated
upper classes, and yet were
in full sympathy with the
common people, who had
just obtained political control
of the country. If they
had been demagogues or as
ignorant of the principles of
government as many of their
supporters, they might indeed
have precipitated the
reign of anarchy the Federalists
feared. On the contrary,
they governed as well
as their aristocratic opponents
could have done,
and so the Federalist party,
which had succeeded so well
in establishing the government,
but had unwisely ignored the wishes of the people, sank
into insignificance, without any serious detriment to the nation.
The Revolution of 1801, as the Democratic-Republican victory
has been called, was a beneficent one, chiefly because it took
place under the direction and control of trained statesmen.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s284'></a><span class='bold'>284. Leading Public Men.</span>—Jefferson made a good beginning
by delivering a conciliatory inaugural address<a id='r115'/><a href='#f115' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[115]</span></sup></a> and by
not making a wholesale
removal of Federalist
officeholders.
Where commissions
had not been delivered
to Adams’s late appointees,
he withheld them,
and he removed obnoxious
partisans, but on
the whole his attitude
toward the civil service
was fairly conservative.
His Cabinet appointments
were good,
and throughout his two
terms he had the cordial
support of his
subordinates. Madison,
who was much under
his influence, was a
prudent and able statesman,
and made a dignified Secretary of State. Albert Gallatin<a id='r116'/><a href='#f116' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[116]</span></sup></a>
of Pennsylvania, as Secretary of the Treasury, proved
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
himself second only to Hamilton as a financier. Gallatin was
by birth a Swiss, and is a striking example of what a foreign-born
citizen of integrity and talents can accomplish in free
America. The leading man in the House of Representatives
was the Virginian, John Randolph of Roanoke, one of the
most brilliant and interesting figures in our history. He was
too independent and one-sided, however, to work long in harmony
with the administration, and became in course of time
the most bitter and effective of its opponents. Another Virginian,
in the judiciary department, was a formidable opponent
of Jefferson. This was John Marshall,<a id='r117'/><a href='#f117' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[117]</span></sup></a> whom Adams, shortly
before he left office, had made Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court. Marshall was a Federalist, and in favor of giving the
general government broader powers than Jefferson and his
party thought either right or expedient. The President and
the great jurist came often into conflict, as, for example, in the
Burr trial (§ <a href='#s290'>290</a>); but on the whole the advantage rested with
Marshall, since he remained in office until his death, in 1835,
and since his decisions steadily helped to build up the power of
the government.</p>

<h3 id='s285a'>MEASURES AND EVENTS.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Stephen Decatur.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s285'></a><span class='bold'>285. Financial Affairs and War with the Barbary States.</span>—One
of the first matters that occupied the new administration was
the reduction of taxes and the decrease of the public debt,
which had grown rapidly in consequence of the preparations
for war with France. The army was greatly reduced,<a id='r118'/><a href='#f118' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[118]</span></sup></a> and
much less was spent on the navy—a branch of the service
which had grown under Adams, but with which Jefferson, as
an agriculturist, had little sympathy. He endeavored to
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
economize in other ways, especially by doing away with
internal taxes and with the unnecessary judges added by the
Federalists, but he naturally
found that the demands
of a growing
country had to be met.
Still, the next ten years
were distinctly a period of
retrenchment, in spite of
the cost of Louisiana and
of the small war waged
against the piratical Barbary
States (1801–1806).
These “pests of Christendom”
had become too impudent
in their demands
for tribute in return for
promised immunity of
American shipping in the
Mediterranean, and they
had to be brought to their
senses by the bombardment
of Tripoli. The war
furnished training to our sailors, and gave Lieutenant Stephen
Decatur<a id='r119'/><a href='#f119' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[119]</span></sup></a> great fame for his exploit in burning one of our
frigates, so that she could be of no use to the enemy.<a id='r120'/><a href='#f120' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[120]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s286'></a><span class='bold'>286. The Louisiana Purchase.</span>—This purchase was the most
important feature of either of Jefferson’s administrations. The
colony of Louisiana, which comprised a vast stretch of territory
west of the Mississippi, had, as we have seen, been ceded
by France to Spain in 1763 (§ <a href='#s115'>115</a>). In 1800 Spain ceded it
back to France. As the latter country was far more powerful
and dangerous than the former, and as the ambitious Napoleon
then ruled France, great alarm was felt in America at the prospect
of having a rival nation grow up across the Mississippi.
Affairs were made still more serious by the denial of the right
of depositing their goods at the port of New Orleans to the
inhabitants of our Western country. These citizens were thus
unable to transfer their merchandise from river boats to ocean
vessels, and were cut off from profitable markets. Even the
pacific Jefferson took the alarm,<a id='r121'/><a href='#f121' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[121]</span></sup></a> and James Monroe of Virginia
was dispatched to France to try to buy a strip of territory including
New Orleans. Because of the impending war between
Great Britain and France, and the consequent necessity of
defending Louisiana, and for other reasons, Napoleon just before
Monroe’s arrival made the regular American Minister,
R. R. Livingston, an offer to sell the whole Louisiana region.
His offer was accepted, and the price was set at fifteen million
dollars, less certain claims against the French.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/m16.jpg' alt='' id='m16' style='width:500px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>The Louisiana Purchase</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s287'></a><span class='bold'>287. Controversy over the Purchase.</span>—Jefferson declared, consistently
with his own principles, that no power to acquire
territory was allowed the general government by the Constitution,
and that therefore an amendment must be made to that
document in order that the purchase might be valid. But an
amendment would take time, and unless the bargain were
closed at once the new territory might be lost forever, especially
as Spain was indignant on account of Napoleon’s action.
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
So the treaty was ratified, and a strict constructionist President
furnished a weighty precedent to his political opponents. The
latter, however, did not perceive the value of Louisiana to the
Union, and would have been better pleased had Jefferson
clung to his principles. Yet it is clear that he was right, and
the Federalists wrong. The contiguity of the territory made
it necessary that it should belong to the United States, and it
was better to buy it than to fight for it at some future day. It
is true that the boundaries of the region were unsettled, and
were sure to cause trouble, and that a spread of slavery was
also involved. But the people were wise when they indorsed
Jefferson’s action by reëlecting him in 1804 by an overwhelming
majority. Jefferson himself was wise in not speculating
whether or not the states formed west of the Mississippi
would adhere to the Union,—the Federalists feared they
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
would not,—and in having the new region explored by Lewis
and Clark and Lieutenant Pike. So great was the opposition
of New England to this acquisition of territory by the nation,
that some Federalist leaders actually thought that they might
persuade the Eastern states to detach themselves from the
Union. Their schemes were abortive, but were destined soon
to bear bitter fruit (§§ <a href='#s313'>313</a>-<a href='#s315'>315</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s288'></a><span class='bold'>288. The Election of 1804.</span>—The election of 1804 was held
under the Twelfth Amendment (§ <a href='#s281'>281</a>). Burr, who had
endeavored to secure the Presidency through Federalist help,
and who was besides, as we have seen, a suspicious character,
was not available for reëlection to the Vice Presidency. Jefferson
was therefore given George Clinton, of New York, as
a colleague. The two Federalist candidates, C. C. Pinckney
and Rufus King of New York, received but fourteen electoral
votes, so complete was the demoralization of the party.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s289'></a><span class='bold'>289. Burr’s Conspiracy.</span>—Burr ran as an independent candidate
for the governorship of New York, but was defeated,
again chiefly through the instrumentality of Hamilton. In
consequence, he picked a quarrel with the latter, which led to
a duel. Hamilton was killed at the first shot, and the death
of so brilliant a man in such a manner aroused the indignation
of the entire country.<a id='r122'/><a href='#f122' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[122]</span></sup></a> Burr became almost an outcast. As
he was an ambitious schemer, he undertook in 1806 to induce
a secession of the Western states from the Union. He seems
also to have dreamed of playing the part of Napoleon in the
New World, and of establishing an empire in Texas or Mexico.
He gained the support of a well-to-do Irish gentleman named
Blennerhassett, who helped to gather arms and men in Ohio
and Kentucky, and as a consequence ruined himself and
family. Burr also tampered with other leading citizens of the
West, particularly with General Wilkinson, the American commander
at New Orleans, who reported his schemes to Jefferson.
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
After some delay, the President made use of local militia, and
Burr’s expedition was reduced to a fiasco, only about one hundred
men descending the Mississippi with him. He finally
abandoned these, and after some wandering in the almost uninhabited
territory that lay to the south of Tennessee, he was
captured and sent to Richmond, Virginia, for trial (1807).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s290'></a><span class='bold'>290. Burr’s Trial.</span>—Jefferson showed great interest in the
case, and almost seemed pitted against Chief Justice Marshall.
The latter ordered the President to appear as a witness, but
the Executive very properly refused to do anything beyond
sending papers. Marshall declared that an overt act of treason
must be proved, but as Burr had not yet levied war against the
United States or adhered to their enemies,—actions constituting
treason according to the Constitution,—and as his mustering
of men had not taken place in Virginia, there was little or
nothing for the prosecuting attorneys to proceed on, and the
case came to an abrupt close. Marshall’s decision has probably
done good in making trials for treason practically unknown
in the United States. But he can hardly be acquitted of having
allowed his feelings against Jefferson to get the better of
him. On the other hand, Jefferson had, in his easy-going way,
allowed Burr to go too far before interfering with his plans.
Burr himself went to England, then returned to New York,
and soon passed from public notice.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s291'></a><span class='bold'>291. The Impeachment of Justice Chase.</span>—Two years previous
to the miscarriage of justice in Burr’s case, another trial of a different
nature had failed almost as signally. This was the trial,
before the Senate, of Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme
Court. Chase was a violent Federalist, who had been impeached
by the Democratic-Republican House of Representatives
for partisan conduct on the bench. He was ably defended,
while John Randolph, who led the prosecution, completely mismanaged
his case. The result was a failure to convict (1805).</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s292'></a><span class='bold'>292. Troubles with Great Britain and France.</span>—More serious
matters now confronted Jefferson. Since the signing of Jay’s
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
Treaty, American shipping had flourished, owing to the fact
that being a neutral nation, the United States could convey to
France and Spain the produce of their West Indian colonies,
the ships of the two European countries not being serviceable
on account of the war
with Great Britain,
whose fleets swept the
ocean. By 1805, however,
the jealousy of
British shipowners
had been aroused and
the Prime Minister,
William Pitt the
Younger, applied to
American vessels what
was known as the
“Rule of 1756.” This
prevented a neutral
from enjoying, in time
of war, trading privileges
not allowed in
time of peace. British
men-of-war, therefore,
began to seize
American ships, and the old impressment abuses were increased.
Meanwhile, Jay’s Treaty expired, and a new treaty, signed
by Monroe and William Pinkney, a brilliant Maryland lawyer
and orator, was not honorable to us and was not even laid before
the Senate. One provision of it ran, that Great Britain would
not be bound by it unless the United States undertook to resist
Napoleon’s Berlin Decree of November 21, 1806. This was
a paper blockade of the British Isles, in retaliation for the
British blockade of the Continent. In other words, Napoleon,
who by that time had humbled most of the sovereigns of
Europe, had declared Continental ports closed to British ships,
although he had no effective means of keeping them out.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
Great Britain wished to force America to take sides against
France. An Order in Council of November, 1807, actually
authorized the seizure of any neutral vessel on a voyage
to closed ports, unless it had previously touched at a British
port. To this order Napoleon replied by the Milan Decree
(December, 1807), authorizing the capture of any vessel that
had entered a British port. Thus American neutral trade was
practically an impossibility, and an important portion of our
population was seriously affected.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s293'></a><span class='bold'>293. The Embargo.</span>—Under these harassing circumstances,
Jefferson was forced to adopt a more energetic foreign policy
than at all suited his pacific disposition. Diplomatic efforts
were wasted on headstrong opponents, who despised a weak,
young nation. So the Non-intercourse Act, forbidding the
importation of goods from Great Britain or her colonies,
was passed in the spring of 1806, but did not go into effect
for nearly two years; by 1808 it had been determined that
mere non-importation was not a sufficiently drastic remedy,
and that an embargo, forbidding all American vessels to leave
for foreign ports, was necessary. In the interim, relations
with Great Britain had been strained to the point of breaking,
through the fact that on June 27, 1807, the British ship
<span class='it'>Leopard</span>, acting under the orders of an admiral at Halifax,
fired on the American frigate <span class='it'>Chesapeake</span>, and took from the
latter four sailors, three of whom were American citizens.<a id='r123'/><a href='#f123' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[123]</span></sup></a>
Jefferson at once ordered British warships out of American
waters and tried to bring the impressment controversy to
an issue, but the British merely disavowed the action of their
admiral. This conduct, together with the Order in Council of
November, 1807, precipitated the Embargo.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s294'></a><span class='bold'>294. Nature and Object of the Embargo.</span>—The Embargo was
partly intended to save the lives and property of the Americans—who
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
were, nevertheless, willing to risk both on account of
the great profits accruing from trade with Europe—by preventing
ships from leaving port and running the risk of being
captured by British men-of-war, or of being confiscated in Continental
ports. Jefferson, however, had another object in view.
He believed that both England and Europe would suffer so
much from the loss of the American trade that the combatants
would be forced to abandon their repressive measures against
the ships of neutrals. He miscalculated the stubbornness and
malignity of both parties, and both Non-intercourse and Embargo,
instead of proving coercive, proved irritating and mischievous.
Nevertheless, there was precedent in favor of the
experiment, and from the point of view of general human welfare
Jefferson was justified in trying it. From the point of
view of politics, the experiment was disastrous, but the fact
that he induced Congress to adopt it is a conclusive proof of
Jefferson’s capacity to control men.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s295'></a><span class='bold'>295. Difficulty of Enforcing the Embargo.</span>—It proved very
difficult, however, to enforce such legislation, for the Federalists
made capital out of it, while Jefferson’s Southern supporters
upheld it against their wills. New England ships rotted at
their wharves, and in Virginia the staple tobacco remained
unsold. Jefferson was overwhelmed with petitions to change
his policy, but held out persistently. The British government
also held to its former course and Napoleon to his. Before
Jefferson’s second term had expired, it was quite clear that new
measures must be tried in order to assert the nation’s dignity
abroad and to secure civil peace at home. The pupil Madison,
who became President in 1809, had to undo in part, at least,
the work of the master.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s296'></a><span class='bold'>296. General View of Jefferson’s Administrations.</span>—Viewed
as a whole, Jefferson’s two administrations do not prove him to
have been a great executive. He was a political philosopher
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
rather than a practical statesman. He was more at home with
ideas than with facts. But by his purchase of Louisiana he saved
the country far more than his ineffective
diplomacy and his Embargo
cost it, and he proved conclusively
that democracy was not contradictory
to the idea of union. He
proved also that the responsibilities
of office are likely always to prevent
a theorist from going to extremes;
for, although the father of the strict
constructionists of the Constitution, he left them the difficult
task of explaining at least one
very loose construction of his
own. Perhaps at another period
his weakness might not have
been apparent. He was intellectually
far in advance of his
countrymen, and was thus an object
of suspicion to many worthy
citizens of a land which had then
done little for the cause of letters
or of science. On the other hand,
he only slowly and partly outgrew
the prejudices of the agricultural
class to which he belonged.
It was not until late in life that he
showed sympathy with the manufacturing
and commercial enterprise which was destined in a
few years to make the country of Robert Fulton<a id='r124'/><a href='#f124' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[124]</span></sup></a> and Eli

No other man has ever so thoroughly
brought the people to
his way of thinking, or so completely
held his own with politicians
of all degrees of ability and
ambition. Congress followed his
lead almost blindly, even in military
matters, about which he
knew little. His popularity
speedily recovered from the decline
it experienced during the
days of the Embargo, and for
nearly twenty years his home
at Monticello was almost like a
pilgrim’s shrine. His fame has
suffered at the hands of some historians,
but it is not unlikely that posterity will conclude that
he was in advance not merely of his age, but of his century.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s298'></a><span class='bold'>298. Madison’s Perplexities.</span>—Just before Madison’s accession
to the Presidency the Embargo was supplanted by a non-intercourse
law which permitted trade with nations not controlled
by France or Great Britain. This legitimate trade and the large
amount of fraudulent shipping that went on brought temporary
wealth to American shipowners, and there even seemed to be a
prospect of a treaty with Great Britain. People began to say
that Madison was a better President than his predecessor, who
continued to advise him. As a matter of fact, he was a weaker
man, had a poorer Cabinet, and was soon involved in greater
difficulties than those encountered by Jefferson. For British
statesmanship was at that time at a very low ebb; the concessions
agreed to by Erskine, the British envoy, were disavowed
at home, and a new envoy actually ventured to insult
Madison by accusing him of deception in negotiations relating
to the prospective treaty. Yet party politics were at a still
lower ebb in this country, as is shown by the fact that the
Federalists showered social attentions on James Jackson, the
envoy who had so grossly insulted the President. Nevertheless
Congress, tired of legislation that seemed to produce
no effect either on England or on France, did away with
non-intercourse, with the proviso that if one of the two
contending powers annulled its vexatious decrees and the
other did not, non-intercourse should be maintained with the
nation still holding out (“Macon’s Bill,” No. 2, May 1, 1810).
Napoleon took advantage of this proviso, although really showing
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
America very little favor. He showed enough, however,
to make Great Britain appear most in the wrong, and on
November 1, 1810, Madison issued a proclamation declaring
trade suspended with that power. This was a sorry commentary
on the proclamation of the preceding April renewing trade with
Great Britain; for the sole result of the diplomacy of the year
had been to let loose more American ships to be captured by the
British or confiscated by the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s299'></a><span class='bold'>299. War Advocated.</span>—Madison, who was prudent like Jefferson,
and who was more of a student of politics than a vigorous
man of affairs, did not desire war with either Great Britain or
France any more than Jefferson had done, but he was forced into
hostilities with the former power before the close of his first
administration. The temper of the American people had been
sorely tried by the Embargo and the non-intercourse policy as
well as by British arrogance throughout the whole controversy.
British statesmen spoke ill of Americans when they should have
tried to enlist their sympathies in the war Great Britain was
waging against despotism personified in Napoleon. The British
were also thought to have stirred up the Western Indians, who
were crushed on Tippecanoe River by General William Henry
Harrison in 1811. The Western people were thus greatly embittered
against Great Britain, and Henry Clay of Kentucky
represented their feelings when, as Speaker of the new House
of Representatives, he helped to force Madison into consenting
to war. With Clay were joined many young, high-spirited men,
some of whom, like John C. Calhoun<a id='r126'/><a href='#f126' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[126]</span></sup></a> of South Carolina, while
adhering to the Jefferson-Madison school of politics, were inclined
to be impatient with their more cautious elders. It is
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
said that they threatened Madison with loss of a second term
if he would not agree to war with Great Britain.<a id='r127'/><a href='#f127' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[127]</span></sup></a> Their policy
eventually proved
beneficial to the country,
since it strengthened
the national
spirit and showed
that the new generation
contained men
too strong to be bound
by the traditions of
the Revolutionary period;
but it was tardy
and lacking in cosmopolitan
breadth of
view.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s300'></a><span class='bold'>300. Outlook for the
War of 1812.</span>—Not
only was the War of
1812 a political blunder
in so far as it
helped Napoleon by
harassing Great Britain,
but also owing to the condition of America at the
time of its inception. The national finances were by no
means adequate to its cost, and the incompetence of Gallatin’s
successor in the Treasury Department made the borrowing
that had to be undertaken especially burdensome. The
army, too, was small and poorly officered at the first. The
volunteers were brave and in the West were very anxious to
serve, but they and their leaders absurdly overrated the ease
with which Canada could be conquered. Henry Clay actually
boasted that his Kentucky constituents could accomplish this
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
exploit without assistance. Besides, the political discontent of
New England, where the Federalists were English sympathizers,
and where much capital was invested in shipping which would
be cooped up during the war, made it difficult to secure militia
from the very portion of the country nearest the chief seat of
operations. Volunteers were indeed obtained from New England,
and after a while both officers and men made a better
showing in the field. But when all is said, the land operations
of the war, except in the splendid instance of the battle of
New Orleans, afford little cause for patriotic gratification. A
prediction to this effect might have been made about the navy,
for the less than two score American vessels seemed but a bagatelle
in comparison with the British navy, which contained about
fifty times as many.<a id='r128'/><a href='#f128' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[128]</span></sup></a> But in the end the exploits of our seamen
formed almost the sole bright spot in an exceedingly gloomy
period.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s301'></a><span class='bold'>301. Opening of the War.</span>—War was formally declared on June
18, 1812, the majority in neither house being overwhelming.
Two days previously the obnoxious Orders in Council had been
revoked. Although the news was received on this side of the
ocean before hostilities had fairly begun, the government adhered
to its tardy determination to fight. This course seemed
justifiable since the impressment trouble and the blockade of
the coasts still called for redress, and the temper of at least a
part of the nation had been inflamed.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s302'></a><span class='bold'>302. Hull’s Surrender.</span>—It was easy to perceive from the
outset that the theater of the war on land would be much the
same as in the French and Indian War—that is, it would
stretch along our northern boundary from Maine to Lake
Michigan. The main attacks by the Americans would be
made through Lakes Ontario and Champlain. At first, bodies
of troops were moved over the border from Detroit and
Buffalo. General William Hull, the governor of Michigan Territory,
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
who led the first advance with over two thousand troops,
mainly volunteers from Ohio, was ignominiously repulsed by
the Canadians and surrendered Detroit in a cowardly manner
(August 16, 1812), for which he was afterward court-martialed
and found guilty. Hull had issued a very boastful proclamation
on his entry into Canada, and his surrender of an important
fortress without firing a gun was almost unpardonable, in view
of such high-flown pretensions. Altogether, the Canadians
under Isaac Brock, the able governor of Upper Canada, with
their allies, the Indians under
Tecumseh, a famous warrior and
the inveterate foe of the Americans,
had outmaneuvered their opponents,
and proved conclusively
that the volunteers, rapidly gathering
in Ohio and Kentucky,
would have to be well led in
order to secure any success. To
get such leaders was not easy,
but Madison finally selected the
right man in General William
Henry Harrison, the victor at
Tippecanoe (§ <a href='#s299'>299</a>). It was late
in the year, however, and the
country was a very difficult one
to penetrate. The impatient public had therefore to wait
quietly for the success that was to retrieve the early losses,
among which may be mentioned the capture of Fort Dearborn,
on the site of the present city of Chicago.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s303'></a><span class='bold'>303. Other Defeats.</span>—Meanwhile General Van Rensselaer, of
the New York militia, had gathered about six thousand eager
men, and on October 13 was forced, by the general impatience for
a victory, prematurely to cross the Niagara River from Lewiston
to Queenstown. Hull’s surrender had left Brock free to manage
the Canadian defense. The American regulars fought well,
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
but the militia crossed only in part, and the result was another
surrender. Yet the enemy also suffered heavily, for the brave
Brock fell defending the heights of Queenstown, where his tall
monument may now be seen. Van Rensselaer, for his part,
resigned, and was succeeded by the still less capable General
Alexander Smyth, who imitated Hull in bragging and in ineffectiveness,
but who dismissed his volunteers to their homes
instead of surrendering them. Equally futile were the attempts
to reach Canada by way of Lake Champlain; and the
year would have ended in complete gloom, so far as land operations
were concerned, had not the Americans, in their turn,
repulsed an invading force at Ogdensburg. In the latter fight
Jacob Brown, a Quaker farmer of New York, showed that he
was the coming general for the war in the northeast, if that
war were to be carried on seriously and not with manifestoes
and ill-directed sallies of raw troops. Another soldier of merit
was also discovered in the person of Lieutenant Colonel Winfield
Scott, a young Virginian who fought finely at Queenstown
Heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s304'></a><span class='bold'>304. The War at Sea.</span>—On the sea, events took a different
turn from the first, although the government’s main intention
was to use its few ships<a id='r129'/><a href='#f129' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[129]</span></sup></a> in guarding the chief ports. On
August 19, 1812, Captain Isaac Hull<a id='r130'/><a href='#f130' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[130]</span></sup></a> of the frigate <span class='it'>Constitution</span><a id='r131'/><a href='#f131' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[131]</span></sup></a>
(44 guns), which had previously been chased into Boston by
a British squadron, met in the Gulf of St. Lawrence the enemy’s
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
<span class='it'>Guerrière</span> (38 guns), which had made an unsavory reputation
for itself by searching American vessels. The American ship
was somewhat the stronger, but no one could have foreseen
that she would overcome her adversary within half an hour.
About two months later (October 18), in a very similar contest,
the American sloop of war <span class='it'>Wasp</span> (18 guns), under Captain
Jacob Jones, took the
British brig <span class='it'>Frolic</span> (20
guns). In consequence
of these unexpected
victories Great Britain’s
naval prestige
was greatly shaken
and American pride
correspondingly stimulated.
Analysis has
shown that the results
were mainly due to the
better gunnery of the
Americans. Equally
fortunate for the
younger nation were
the fights between the
frigate <span class='it'>United States</span>
(44 guns), under Captain
Decatur (§ <a href='#fn117'>285, note 1</a>),
and the British
frigate <span class='it'>Macedonian</span> (38 guns); and between the <span class='it'>Constitution</span>,
then under Captain Bainbridge, and the British <span class='it'>Java</span>. The
former contest took place near the Madeiras, on October 25;
the latter, off the coast of Brazil, on December 29, 1812. Congress
immediately authorized the building of new ships, and
while the British were able to sweep American commerce from
the seas, the people consoled themselves with the thought of
the superb victories of their ships and of the damage American
privateers were doing English shipping on every ocean and
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
sea—even within Dublin Bay itself. At last, however, reverses
came, when, in 1813, the <span class='it'>Chesapeake</span><a id='r132'/><a href='#f132' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[132]</span></sup></a> was captured by
the British <span class='it'>Shannon</span>, and when
our ships were blockaded in our
chief harbors. But the privateers
continued their exploits
until they raised British rates
of insurance on trading vessels
to a very high percentage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s305'></a><span class='bold'>305. Victories of Perry and
Harrison.</span>—Meanwhile the war
was not popular in Great Britain
or in New England. The
South and West still favored it,
however, and Congress helped
Madison by allowing him to
use twenty new regiments of
regulars in place of volunteers.
A new Secretary of War,
General Armstrong, late minister to France, took the place of
Eustis, who was unfitted to cope with the difficulties of the
position. But the year was to witness few signal successes
beyond an important victory on Lake Erie that led to the retaking
of Detroit. Captain Oliver H. Perry<a id='r133'/><a href='#f133' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[133]</span></sup></a> had a flotilla constructed
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
at Presque Isle (now Erie), and on September 10 met
and defeated the British flotilla under Captain Barclay. The
British had more guns,
but the Americans,
after Perry had been
obliged to abandon his
flagship, gained a complete
victory through
their courage and skill.
Perry, who was coöperating
with Harrison,
wrote the latter
on the back of an old
letter, “We have met
the enemy and they
are ours.” Harrison’s
army, helped by the
American ships, then
passed to Detroit and
afterward landed in
Canada, where, at the
battle of the Thames
River, the British, under Colonel Proctor and their Indian
allies, were completely routed (October 5). Tecumseh fell
in this fight, and a portion of Upper Canada passed under
American control, Michigan having been, of course, regained.<a id='r134'/><a href='#f134' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[134]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s306'></a><span class='bold'>306. American Failures.</span>—A great invasion of Canada and the

<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
abandoned, General Dearborn seizing only a few places, including
York (now Toronto), which was unnecessarily burned. Brown,
Scott, and others showed that American soldiers could be brave,
but the campaign was on the whole a failure. General Wilkinson
then succeeded Dearborn, but, like the latter, was too old for
the work, and was besides at loggerheads with Secretary Armstrong
and with his second in command, General Wade Hampton
of South Carolina. An attack on Montreal or else on Kingston
was planned, but Armstrong mixed matters up by assuming
the command. Hampton failed to coöperate with Wilkinson,
who had had a hard time descending the St. Lawrence, and
the latter general was obliged to put his troops into winter
quarters with nothing accomplished. Meanwhile the force on
the weakened Niagara frontier had recrossed the river after
burning the town of Newark. The British retaliated in kind
and with their Indian allies did much damage on the American
side of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s307'></a><span class='bold'>307. Jackson and the Indians.</span>—While these events had been
taking place in the North, the Southwest had not been quiet.
British and Spanish emissaries were stirring up the Southern
Indians to attack the Americans. The Creeks had also been
excited by Tecumseh, who used a comet and an earthquake to
work upon their superstitious fears. The savages massacred
the white settlers at Fort Mims, Alabama, on August 30, 1813,
slaying or roasting to death four hundred persons. Retaliation
came swiftly. The Tennesseean volunteers under General
Andrew Jackson invaded the Creek country, and with the help
of troops from Mississippi completely defeated the Indians at
the battle of the Horseshoe, or Tohopeka (March 27, 1814).</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s308'></a><span class='bold'>308. Outlook for 1814.</span>—The year 1814 opened gloomily in
spite of Harrison’s and Perry’s victories. There was still much
improvement needed in the methods of raising troops, the War
Department was badly managed, and the finances were in a
wretched condition. Worst of all, good leaders were lacking.
Besides, the British navy was beginning to ravage the Atlantic
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
coast, and Napoleon’s
power being
on the wane, the
strength of the
United Kingdom
could be more
fully employed
against America.
Russia, however,
had proffered her
good services as
a mediator, and
Gallatin and
James A. Bayard were sent to St. Petersburg to join John
Quincy Adams, minister at that court, in securing this powerful
influence. The British government discouraged the Czar’s
offers, but as it had
great European interests
to settle, it was
not so much inclined
to fight to a finish
with the United
States as it might
otherwise have been.</p>

mistake was made
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
with regard to the scene of operations, but when the fighting
began near Niagara Falls, Brown gave a good account of himself.
At Chippewa and Lundy’s Lane (July 5 and 25), leaders
like Winfield Scott distinguished themselves, and the American
troops showed themselves the equals of British regulars,
and won honor, if no substantial military gains. Commodore
Thomas Macdonough<a id='r135'/><a href='#f135' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[135]</span></sup></a> also repeated Perry’s exploit of destroying

On board was General Ross with
several thousand troops. Washington,
Virginia, and Maryland were
evidently in danger and great efforts
were made to meet the invaders—unfortunately
to little purpose, on
account of the incapacity of Secretary
Armstrong. The British landed
and began their march to Washington,
easily putting the undisciplined
American militia to flight at Bladensburg,
Maryland (August 24).
Our troops evacuated Washington,
and the British entered. They
retaliated for the burning of York by setting fire to the
White House, the unfinished Capitol, and other buildings.
It was an act of vandalism that cannot be defended; but
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
fortunately the next city attacked repulsed the invaders courageously.
This was Baltimore, before which the British troops
were driven back, General Ross being slain, and from which
the British fleet retired after a vain bombardment of Fort
McHenry (September 12 and 13). The song of “The Star Spangled

<p class='pindent'><a id='s311'></a><span class='bold'>311. The Battle of New Orleans.</span>—It soon became apparent
that the attacks on Washington and Baltimore had been
of secondary importance,
and that
the real object of
the British fleet
was to capture
New Orleans, and
snatch the newly
acquired Louisiana
from the United
States. James Monroe,
who had succeeded
Armstrong
as Secretary of War,
at once called upon
the ablest soldier
in the Southwest,
Andrew Jackson.<a id='r136'/><a href='#f136' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[136]</span></sup></a>
The latter gathered
his forces, and although
he first tried
an expedition into
Florida against the
British and Indians, he set to work at the defenses of New
Orleans in good season. The large British fleet effected a
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
landing safely, and by December 23 the troops were only a
few miles from the city. The main battle occurred on January
8, 1815, and the backwoodsmen
behind their works destroyed
the flower of the British army
who had the hardihood to make
a front attack. Sir Edward
Pakenham, the British commander,
was killed, after having
been for days outgeneralled
by Jackson; and at least two
thousand veterans, many of
whom had followed Wellington
in the Spanish Peninsula,
lay dead or wounded on the
field. The American loss, on
the other hand, was almost incredibly slight—about twenty
men all told.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s312'></a><span class='bold'>312. The Treaty of Ghent.</span>—If those had been the days of
the telegraph, the battle of New Orleans would not have been
fought, and the American people would have had no great
land victory to salve the pride that had been touched to
the quick by the capture of Washington, Hull’s surrender,
and other disgraceful events of the war. On December 24,
1814, American and British commissioners had signed a
treaty of peace at Ghent. Adams, Gallatin, and Bayard,
who were already abroad, had been joined by Henry Clay
and Jonathan Russell; and the five had defended American
interests very well. Gallatin was the most influential
member and succeeded in curbing the zeal of Clay and
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
Adams, who wished to press matters like the British
right to navigate the Mississippi and the fisheries question,
in which the people of the West and of New England took
a great interest. Curiously enough, the treaty did not touch
the impressment abuse, or the right of searching vessels,
for the sake of which, in the main, the war had been waged.
Still, after her naval victories, America was not likely to
suffer in the future from such abuses. Each side restored
the territory of the other that it occupied, and both felt relieved
that the anomalous war was over.</p>

<h3 id='s313a'>THE DISAFFECTION OF NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s313'></a><span class='bold'>313. Political Events.</span>—Political events in Madison’s second
administration were naturally overshadowed by the war or
else connected with it. As we have seen, the finances were
badly managed, nor were the affairs of the War Department
on a better footing. Congress was scarcely more efficient,
especially when its Speaker, Henry Clay, was absent with the
commissioners at Ghent. But the disaffection of the New England
Federalists was the most serious element in the political
problem. With the waning of their party and the assured
success of the Democratic-Republicans, they naturally grew
more rancorous. They coquetted with the British before and
during the war, and they had little or no sympathy with
the idea that the United States was a nation. In the debate
in 1811 on the admission of Louisiana as a state, one of their
leaders, Josiah Quincy of Massachusetts, actually declared
that the passage of the bill would be a virtual dissolution
of the Union, and that it would be the duty of some of
the states, “to prepare for a separation amicably” if they
could, “violently if they must.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s314'></a><span class='bold'>314. Reasons for New England’s Attitude.</span>—This attitude
seems at first wholly indefensible, but we must remember
both at this juncture and in dealing later with the secession
of the South, that the idea of national unison was one of
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
very slow growth, and that threats of secession or of violent
resistance to the Union had been heard already from Southern,
Western, and Middle states. States were still jealous of their
prestige, and the language of the Constitution lent itself to
interpretations that reduced the power of the nation to a
minimum. Besides, New England had suffered greatly from
the enforced idleness of its shipping during the Embargo and
from the captures made by the British. Consequently, just
as men are always inclined to do, they held the national
government responsible for matters that often lay beyond
its control. Their pro-British sympathies, although certainly
carried beyond the bounds of decency, may be partly extenuated
for these reasons. When they went farther, and
refused to put the state militia at the service of the Union,
they took a dangerous step, but one not entirely indefensible
on strict constructionist grounds. It was a sure precursor,
however, of more determined and less defensible opposition.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s315'></a><span class='bold'>315. The Hartford Convention.</span>—Success in state elections
gave the political solidarity that was needed, and the increasing
pressure of hostilities in the year 1814 gave the needed stimulus,
for effective opposition to the war on the part of New England.
After speeches and resolutions as strenuous as those that
nerved Virginia and Kentucky to their resistance of the Alien
and Sedition laws, passed half a generation before by the Federalists
themselves, a call was issued by Massachusetts for a
convention of the New England States. This met at Hartford,
Connecticut, on December 15, 1814. After a few weeks of secret
debate its members issued a remarkable report. This document
asserted the doctrine of states’ rights in its most
naked form, suggested amendments to the Constitution of the
United States looking to the protection of the interests of
minorities, and demanded for the states the right to claim the
customs duties collected within their own borders. This last
provision would have been of itself enough to destroy the
power of the Union, but fortunately there was no need even to
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
discuss it. The commissioners sent to Washington to propose
it to Congress found that peace had been declared and that their
chief ground of grievance had been removed. They had, therefore,
nothing to do but to hasten home in chagrin. The Federalist
party did not survive their last attack upon the general
government, and for several years after 1815 there was practically
only one party in the country. This fact is not surprising
when we remember that accession to power had rendered
the leading Republicans as desirous of maintaining a fairly
strong government as the moderate Federalists were.</p>

<h3 id='s316a'>CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s316'></a><span class='bold'>316. Some Results of the War.</span>—With the decline of Federalism
came a natural increase of national democratic spirit
and a lessening of the dependence on either Great Britain
or France, which, as we have before seen, had characterized
the generation that grew up just after the Revolution. This
was a clear gain from the war. On the other hand, the interests
of the sections began more sharply to diverge. The North,
during the trouble with England, had taken to manufacturing,
and now began to demand a really protective tariff for its “infant
industries.” This policy, though encouraged by the West
for the sake of certain products like hemp, was soon seen to
bear hard on the South. Previous legislation on the subject
(§ <a href='#s266'>266</a>) had paved the way for an effective tariff, and the influx
of British goods brought into the country after the close of the
war showed that the newly developed industries, especially
that of cotton manufacture, which had increased greatly since
1810, would find it hard to subsist without support. So the
tariff act of 1816 was passed, in spite of the opposition of
Daniel Webster, who represented New England shipping interests,
and of John Randolph, who represented the agricultural
South and the stricter forms of Republicanism. The rate (about
twenty-five per cent), placed on imported cotton and woolen
goods, was found practically prohibitive by Southern planters,
who needed coarse clothes for their slaves. Thus the Southerners
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
began to be alienated from the Democratic-Republican
party, although not a few of them helped to pass the act of
1816. Among these was John C. Calhoun, whose leanings
toward a strong government were still pronounced.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s317'></a><span class='bold'>317. The National Bank and Internal Improvements.</span>—The
year 1816 also saw the passage of another financial measure
destined to cause division later. This was the reëstablishment
of a national bank, Hamilton’s bank (§ <a href='#s266'>266</a>) having failed to
secure a second charter in 1811. The financial burdens of the
war had fallen in consequence upon the state banks, which
had not been managed well. Hence the new bank scheme
was favored even by cautious Republicans like Madison. Its
establishment for twenty years, with a largely increased capital,
enabled the country practically to resume a specie basis in
less than a year.<a id='r137'/><a href='#f137' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[137]</span></sup></a> A fund of a million and a half dollars was
paid by it to the government for the privileges granted by the
charter, and the problem how to employ this sum to the best
advantage brought forward still another question involving
conflicting interests.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s318'></a><span class='bold'>318. The Question of Internal Improvements.</span>—At first the
individual states had attended to their internal needs and had
spent considerable sums, especially in improving their water-ways,
but a great scheme for a system of national canals had,
before the war, attracted leading Republicans. Now Calhoun
proposed to use for a similar purpose the money turned in by
the bank. His bill passed Congress, but Madison vetoed it, on
the ground that although such improvements were desirable,
a specific amendment to the Constitution was needed if the
general government was to undertake them.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s319'></a><span class='bold'>319. The Succession of Monroe.</span>—This veto of Madison’s,
which led the people of New York, in default of national aid, to
construct their own Erie Canal, through which New York City

official acts and showed that he was still faithful to the political
creed of Jefferson. He was shortly after (March 4, 1817)
succeeded by his Secretary of State, James Monroe, who had
proved his claim to the succession by developing the nationalistic
ideas that had made Jefferson and Madison safe leaders
in a very critical period. Monroe had also rendered very efficient
service as temporary Secretary of War, and had endeared
himself to the people of every section.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s320'></a><span class='bold'>320. Monroe’s Counselors.</span>—Monroe<a id='r139'/><a href='#f139' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[139]</span></sup></a> was fortunate not only
in having to preside over a united people, but in being able to
secure good advisers. For Secretary of State he chose John
Quincy Adams, son of the former President and a diplomatist
of tried ability, who had done good work for the country
as Minister to Russia and commissioner at Ghent (§ <a href='#s312'>312</a>).
The fact that the son of the great Federalist leader should be
serving in the Cabinet of a Republican President was a signal
proof of the utter demoralization of the old Federalist party.
In the Treasury, Monroe placed William H. Crawford of
Georgia, an able though rather intriguing man whose subsequent
defeat for the Presidency and withdrawal from national
life caused regret to many people. Crawford was more of a
politician than a statesman, and his success showed that public
leaders were undergoing a change of type. The Cabinet was
made preponderatingly Southern by the appointment of Calhoun
as Secretary of War and of William Wirt as Attorney-General.
Its strength, however, was not decreased, for both
made excellent officials, although Wirt was more an advocate
and literary man than a statesman.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s321'></a><span class='bold'>321. The Era of Good Feeling.</span>—Monroe’s name is chiefly
connected to-day with matters of foreign policy, and his administrations
have
been termed “The
Era of Good Feeling,”
because domestic
affairs wore
on the whole so
quiet an aspect.
Yet, as we shall
soon see, the debates
on the subject
of slavery
connected with
the admission of
Missouri as a
state showed that
the country was in
reality far from
united; and the
tariff legislation
of 1824 brought
out the fact still
more clearly in a few years. Harmony was also far from the
minds of the politicians, however united politically the people
might appear to be. Intrigues for the succession to the Presidency
occupied the leading statesmen, and in the combinations
formed by them a careful observer might have perceived the
beginnings of a division into two parties not radically dissimilar
to the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans of the preceding
generation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s322'></a><span class='bold'>322. The Character of Monroe as President.</span>—Monroe has
generally been regarded as the weakest of the early Presidents,
although his popularity was widespread. This view is plausible,
but hardly just. He certainly behaved with great dignity
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
toward the intriguing politicians who were aiming to succeed
him; he showed discretion in adopting from his advisers
the foreign policy that bears his name; and he preserved a
strict impartiality and adherence to the cause of the Union in
the sectional disputes that disturbed his administrations. He
was not a commanding man, yet he deserves to be remembered
as a statesman who outgrew early rashness, and he was
fully entitled to the confidence given him by the masses. For
his second term (1821–1825), indeed, he had no opposition.
But a solitary vote was cast against him, in order, as the story
goes, that Washington should be the only President unanimously
chosen.</p>

<h3 id='s323a'>DIPLOMATIC ACHIEVEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s323'></a><span class='bold'>323. The Oregon Region.</span>—Two boundary disputes with
Great Britain and Spain early occupied the attention of
Monroe and his advisers. The first was mainly concerned
with the so-called Oregon region beyond the Rockies, drained
by the Columbia River, which the United States claimed
through the discovery of this great stream by Captain Robert
Gray in 1792, and through explorations made by Lewis and
Clark (§ <a href='#s287'>287</a>), whom Jefferson had sent out soon after the
purchase of Louisiana (1805). In this region the British
Hudson Bay Company had, however, established trading posts,
and Monroe found that the best thing he could do was to agree
upon the forty-ninth parallel as a northern boundary as far as
the Rockies and upon joint occupancy for ten years of the disputed
territory beyond.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s324'></a><span class='bold'>324. The Acquisition of Florida.</span>—Diplomacy with Spain
was more definitely successful. Ever since the purchase of
Louisiana the United States had claimed that it was entitled
to the strip of land along the Gulf known as West Florida;
but Spain had refused to admit this, or to sell the territory, in
spite of persistent offers to purchase made by Jefferson. In
1810 Madison took possession of the region by proclamation,
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
although it now seems certain that the nation had better
claims on Texas. His action, and the invasion of Florida
by General Andrew Jackson while he was in pursuit of
Indians convinced Spain, however, that she would do well to
sell while she could the outlying peninsula of East Florida.
Accordingly, on February 22, 1819, Adams negotiated a treaty
by which the Floridas were ceded,<a id='r140'/><a href='#f140' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[140]</span></sup></a> and the western boundary
of Louisiana was settled along the Sabine, Red, and Arkansas
rivers to the forty-second parallel, and then along that to
the Pacific. This treaty strengthened American claims to
the Oregon region, and also helped to settle various Indian
and slave troubles connected with East Florida, which had
served as a place of refuge for runaway negroes and other bad
characters. So much disturbance had indeed been caused by
these marauders and by the Seminole Indians, that in 1818
General Andrew Jackson had had to invade Florida, and had
actually taken two towns and done other rather high-handed
acts which nearly led to his being court-martialed.<a id='r141'/><a href='#f141' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[141]</span></sup></a> Spain for
two years delayed ratifying the treaty, but finally yielded to
the inevitable.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s325'></a><span class='bold'>325. The Occasion of the Monroe Doctrine.</span>—A few years later
relations with Spain again became important. Revolutionary
principles had spread in the Spanish colonies to the south, and
by 1822 Spain had lost all her provinces on the mainland. But
the so-called “Holy Alliance,” formed by the principal sovereigns
of continental Europe after the fall of Napoleon, had for its
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
chief object the repression of revolutionary doctrines and outbreaks,
and it seemed not unlikely that a concerted effort might
be made by Europe, not to restore her colonies to Spain, but to
distribute them among the great powers. This was naturally
not to the liking of a people who had themselves revolted, nor
was Great Britain anxious to allow the Alliance to gain too
much headway. Besides, Russia was endeavoring to establish
a colony on the North Pacific, and she and other powers might
easily find pretexts to seize upon territory nearer to the United
States—perhaps upon California. Hence, while overtures for
a joint protest, made by the British statesman, George Canning,
to our Minister to England, Richard Rush, were declined, the
administration soon found it necessary to take a stand in the
matter.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s326'></a><span class='bold'>326. The Monroe Doctrine.</span>—Accordingly, Monroe sent in a
message to Congress in December, 1823, in which he outlined
the policy since known as the “Monroe Doctrine.” This doctrine
was none the less important from the fact that it was
addressed to Congress instead of to the European powers. Its
gist was contained in two assertions: first, that the American
continents were not henceforth to be considered as subjects for
future colonization by any European power; second, that efforts
to coerce the newly established governments would be regarded
as proofs of “an unfriendly disposition toward the United
States.” These firm utterances, for which Monroe was indebted
chiefly to John Quincy Adams, but also to the policy of Washington
and other statesmen and to the advice of Jefferson,
put an end to all fear of European aggression and rendered
Russia reasonable with regard to Alaska. The policy thus outlined
has since been effectively maintained, and it may now be
regarded as beyond the reach of party action. In fact, it has been
extended so as to include more of a guardianship over other
American powers than was contemplated by Monroe. It is
plain from John Quincy Adams’s attitude in the matter of the
Panama Congress (§ <a href='#s337'>337</a>), that the original “Doctrine” contemplated
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
that each power should guard by its own means
against European aggressions.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s327'></a><span class='bold'>327. The Slavery Question.</span>—Turning now to domestic matters,
we find that during Monroe’s two terms, Chief Justice Marshall
delivered many of his most celebrated opinions restraining the
powers of the states in favor of the general government. But
there was one subject which not even a Marshall could have
handled effectively—this was slavery. Slavery had occupied
the attention of the first Congress, which had been petitioned
by anti-slavery societies to abate the evils of the system. In
1793 an act for restoring slaves who had fled from one state
to another was passed. The slave trade had been prohibited
in 1808, as soon as the Constitution allowed, and a great effort
had been made by the American Colonization Society in 1816,
to begin the work of exporting the negroes to Africa; but the
invention of the cotton gin, in 1793, had rendered slavery too
profitable to the far Southern states to make it probable that
they would peaceably consent to the abolishment of the institution.
On the other hand, the number of people who thought
slavery morally wrong had increased in the North and Northwest,
and the way in which new slaveholding and non-slaveholding
states had been admitted into the Union by pairs, so as
not to disturb the balance of power in the Senate, showed that
many Southerners were alive to the dangers of the situation.
Yet, after all, so great was the general desire for internal harmony
that most persons were startled when the debates concerning
the admission of Missouri revealed the fact that the
existence of slavery was a menace to the Union.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s328'></a><span class='bold'>328. The Missouri Controversy.</span>—The inevitable struggle between
slavery and freedom was precipitated by the endeavor
to bring in Arkansas as a territory and Missouri as a state.
Both were to be carved out of that part of the Louisiana Cession
in which slavery had already gained a footing. Northern
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
members of Congress objected to the spread of the institution
into the vast territory still to be occupied, while Southern
members felt that any limitation of slavery was an infringement
on their property rights. If a man could carry his other
chattels when he removed to the new region, why, they asked,
could he not carry those human chattels known as slaves.
Finally Arkansas was organized without mention of slavery,
but a stand was made on Missouri. James Tallmadge, a New
York representative, offered an amendment to the act admitting
Missouri, to the effect that further introduction of slaves into
the proposed state should be prohibited, and that the children
of slaves born after the state’s admission to the Union should
be considered free at the age of twenty-five. The Senate refusing
to concur, the matter went over.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s329'></a><span class='bold'>329. The First Missouri Compromise.</span>—The close of the year
1819 saw a renewal of the contest in the new Congress, which
assembled after the matter had been much discussed in state
legislatures and throughout the country. Alabama was admitted
to balance Illinois; then bills passed the House admitting
Maine<a id='r142'/><a href='#f142' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[142]</span></sup></a> and Missouri, but with the anti-slavery proviso made
applicable to the latter. The Senate would admit Maine only
if Missouri were admitted as a slave state. The House refused
to yield, but finally a compromise was effected. A line was
drawn across the Louisiana Territory at 36° 30′, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> along the
northern boundary of Arkansas, and it was agreed that north
of this line slavery should not exist save in Missouri. This
famous arrangement, which went into effect in March, 1820,
became known as the “Missouri Compromise” and was effective
until new territory was added to the Union as a result of the
Mexican War.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s330'></a><span class='bold'>330. The Second Missouri Compromise.</span>—Missouri was not,
indeed, admitted until 1821, on account of a provision in its
Constitution against allowing free colored men to enter its
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
borders. This obstacle was overcome by the address and
dexterity of Henry Clay<a id='r143'/><a href='#f143' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[143]</span></sup></a> who, as a Virginian by birth and a Kentuckian
by residence,
was in every way
admirably suited to
act as mediator between
the two sections.
He did not
like slavery, and
had been president
of the Colonization
Society; but he understood
how thoroughly
in earnest
the Southern men
were to defend the
institution. He used
all the tact and
personal charm for
which he was conspicuous
among his
contemporaries, and
succeeded in making
the people of
Missouri agree not to deprive citizens of other states of their
rights.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s331'></a><span class='bold'>331. General View of the Compromises.</span>—The Second Compromise
was distinctly ambiguous and meant little; the First
was a sacrifice of principle which, however, was regarded as
necessary at the time. Both sides were in earnest, and the
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
extreme adherents of each stood out to the end for their respective
principles. On the whole, the responsibility for the settlement
rested largely on the
moderate Southerners and on
their Northern and Western
sympathizers, who were very
influential in some states,—for
example, in Illinois. Few
men saw with John Randolph<a id='r144'/><a href='#f144' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[144]</span></sup></a>
that the day of settlement
was only postponed. Whether
it would have been best to
fight the question out then
and there, will always be a
mooted point. Compromise
on matters of principle is
incapable of satisfying men’s
consciences for long; but it
is equally true that principles
cannot be uncompromisingly
maintained with success at all
times and seasons. Fighting unyieldingly for them at the
wrong time may postpone their final triumph indefinitely.
Hence it was, perhaps, best that the forces of freedom were
given time to grow strong and that the Union was not hazarded
at so early a juncture.

<h3 id='s332a'>FACTIONAL POLITICS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s332'></a><span class='bold'>332. Political Factions and the Tariff of 1824.</span>—The fight
over Missouri was not the only indication that the Era of Good
Feeling was to be of short duration. Politics throughout the
country were becoming personal in character and therefore
more or less petty. The influence of the Revolutionary statesmen
was waning, in spite of the prestige of survivors like John
Adams and Jefferson. The right to vote no longer depended
in the main upon the possession of property, as had been the
case when the Union was formed, but was being extended to all
male citizens of the age of twenty-one. This extension of the
franchise was largely due to the example set by the new Western
states, which were naturally far more democratic than the
older commonwealths. As a result, political tricksters were fast
controlling the vote of the masses. Offices were being given for
political services, and congressional caucuses and state cliques
were dictating nominations. The nominating convention, with
its opportunities for “wire-pulling” and its aptitude for selecting
compromise candidates, was also coming into vogue in state
politics, and political clubs, like the “Tammany Society” of
New York, were beginning their sinister work. Under these
circumstances it is no wonder that, as the tariff of 1816 was
not sufficient for their purposes, the manufacturers of the
Middle states and New England should have endeavored to
obtain legislation of a more decidedly protective character.
Aided by the West, which believed with Clay in creating
“a home market” and thus adhering to a truly “American
policy,” they succeeded, in 1824, against the wishes of the
South, in passing a tariff act with higher duties, especially
on wool, woolens, cotton goods, iron, and hemp. They had
nearly succeeded in 1820 in carrying their point. Now, on
the eve of an election, the politicians who were supporting the
various Presidential candidates were afraid to risk votes by
opposing such strong financial interests, and three sections<a id='r145'/><a href='#f145' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[145]</span></sup></a> were
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
in any case stronger than one. But the passage of such an act
under such circumstances was sure to give trouble, for although
in theory designed for the good of the nation, protection really
involved financial loss to one section, the South, which, as a
whole, did not yet realize the fact, but was beginning to do so.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s333'></a><span class='bold'>333. The Presidential Election of 1824.</span>—Meanwhile, the
choice of Monroe’s successor seemed more important than
the tariff. Each of the
candidates was a Democratic-Republican,
a fact
which perhaps made their
struggle all the fiercer.
John Quincy Adams,<a id='r146'/><a href='#f146' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[146]</span></sup></a> as
Secretary of State, had
precedents in his favor,—Jefferson,
Madison, and
Monroe having served in
that capacity,—and he
had also the support of
New England; but his
lack of magnetism counted
greatly against him. Calhoun,
who was still strong
in the North on account
of his nationalistic views,
which, however, he was
fast abandoning, soon contented himself with receiving assurance
of the Vice Presidency. Crawford, whose health was very
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
poor at the time, was nominated by the regular party caucus of
congressmen; but as caucus nominations had grown in disfavor,
this fact hurt his chances. Clay had the support of the West,
and was popular elsewhere. Andrew Jackson, then a senator,
was popular on account of his military record, represented the
democratic masses more nearly than any other candidate, and
had astute political managers. At the election of 1824, Jackson
led with ninety-nine electoral votes; Adams had eighty-four;
Crawford, forty-one; and Clay, thirty-seven. The election thus
went to the House of Representatives, which had to choose
from the three highest names.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s334'></a><span class='bold'>334. Choice of John Quincy Adams.</span>—In February, 1825, the
House, voting by states, chose Adams, for whom, as the best
fitted of the candidates, Clay had used his influence. As Adams
subsequently made Clay Secretary of State, a corrupt bargain
between them was charged, but upon no real grounds. Some
of Jackson’s friends claimed that, as he had received most
votes, the House should have respected the popular will and
chosen him; yet this was equivalent to maintaining that the
Constitution, which had left the House of Representatives full
liberty in the matter, had not been properly framed. But,
although there was no good reason for the discontent expressed,
it remained clear that the Era of Good Feeling was over, and
that Adams would find little comfort in the high office he had
attained.<a id='r147'/><a href='#f147' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[147]</span></sup></a></p>

Among other things, he caused two British subjects, who had stirred up
the Indians, to be hanged, and he got into quite a heated controversy with the
governor of Georgia. As a matter of fact, he grossly exceeded his instructions,
and Calhoun was technically right when he proposed the court-martial.
Monroe and Adams, however, knew that Jackson had acted in what he
believed to be his country’s interest, and they shielded him. It was many
years before Jackson learned who it was that had proposed to court-martial
him. When he found out, a breach with Calhoun followed, which had, as

<h3 id='s335a'><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>FAILURES OF THE ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s335'></a><span class='bold'>335. Character of Adams’s Administration.</span>—Adams was a
statesman of great ability and experience and of high integrity,
but he represented ideas of strong government not pleasing
to the masses. He seemed to be a Federalist veneered with
Democracy. He did not have the faculty of winning and
holding friends. He could not be easy in his manners, and,
on the other hand, his dignity lacked grace. Besides, his
election had been disputed, his opponents were factious, and
events favored him almost as little as they had done his
father. The strongest man in his Cabinet, Clay, was really a
source of weakness to him, for Jackson’s friends continued to
pretend to believe in the corrupt bargain.<a id='r148'/><a href='#f148' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[148]</span></sup></a> Adams’s administration
was, therefore, on the whole, a failure.
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s336'></a><span class='bold'>336. Foreign Affairs.</span>—Even in foreign affairs, where, being
a trained diplomatist, he had been previously successful, things
went against Adams. He secured a number of good commercial
treaties, but lost the important trade with the British West
Indian ports through the failure to comply in time with certain
demands of Great Britain. Perhaps if he had used the tact
afterward displayed by Jackson, he would have secured the
trade without trouble. But, as it was, the fault lay mainly
with Congress, which took delight in humiliating the President.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s337'></a><span class='bold'>337. The Panama Congress.</span>—Adams fared as badly or worse
when he indorsed the scheme of General Bolivar, the South
American patriot hero, for holding at Panama a convention, or
congress, of all the American republics. Both Adams and Clay,
the latter of whom had long taken interest in South American
affairs, believed that through such a congress the influence of
the United States would be extended and the Monroe Doctrine
be more firmly established. But although commissioners were
finally sent to Panama, they arrived too late to participate in
the conference, owing to the protracted debates in Congress on
the propriety of sending them. Although Adams’s opponents
would under any circumstances have delighted to harass him,
these debates were mainly due to the fact that Hayti, a republic
of revolted negro slaves, was to be represented at Panama.
Southern congressmen disliked the social and political recognition
involved, and feared that the subject of slavery might
come up for discussion. As a matter of course, Adams’s opponents
made him bear the brunt of the fiasco.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s338'></a><span class='bold'>338. Internal Improvements.</span>—In domestic affairs the President’s
policy was still more unsuccessful. In his tactless way
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
he favored internal improvements to an extent unwarranted at
the time. He knew of the general prejudice against the government’s
undertaking what the states preferred to do themselves,
and he should have known also that the vetoes of his
two predecessors had carried great weight. Besides, it was
almost amusing to counsel the American people, as he did, to
build observatories, when they were more interested in finances,
public and private, than in astronomy. Some money had indeed
been spent on improvements, especially upon the Cumberland
Road, a highway running through Maryland, West Virginia,
and Ohio, and designed to connect East and West. More money
was spent during Adams’s term; but much opposition was
aroused, particularly in the South, even Calhoun being now
dubious of the constitutionality of such expenditure of the
public funds.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s339'></a><span class='bold'>339. Georgia and the Indians.</span>—Still more humiliating than
anything described yet was Adams’s failure to protect from
the aggressions of the governor and legislature of Georgia, the
Creeks and Cherokees, who lived in a half-civilized condition
within the boundaries of that state. Both tribes had treaty
relations with the United States, and neither owed allegiance
to Georgia. Yet the state proceeded to survey the lands of the
Creeks under a treaty of 1825, before the general government
had had time to investigate the matter. When Adams interfered,
feeling that the Indians were being imposed upon, Governor
Troup used imprudent language, which he reiterated in
1827 under similar circumstances. On the latter occasion he
actually called out state militia to meet the United States
troops. This was pushing the doctrine of state sovereignty to
a very dangerous extreme. As the President got little support
from Congress, he had to brook the insult in spite of a splendid
speech in his behalf by Daniel Webster. A few years later,
as we shall soon see, another state, South Carolina, stood out
against another President, Andrew Jackson, with far less impunity,
Jackson being a more commanding man than Adams,
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
and his opponents less determined. It must be remembered,
too, that although the rash conduct of Georgia’s legislature and
governor deserves partial censure, the people of the state were
acting but naturally, when they endeavored to supplant by
white settlers the Indians within their borders. An Indian
state within a commonwealth was not to be tolerated, and the
United States had in 1802 promised to get the Indians away
as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id='s340a'>THE TARIFF QUESTION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s340'></a><span class='bold'>340. The Tariff of 1828.</span>—Thus far Adams’s conduct had
been above reproach, however much he had failed in carrying
out his various policies. It is less easy to defend his course in
not vetoing the tariff bill of 1828—known in history as the
“Tariff of Abominations.” It is natural that men who have
once tasted the bounty of government should desire more of it;
hence we are not surprised at finding the manufacturers of the
country soon demanding more protection. The most clamorous
advocates of higher duties were the growers and manufacturers
of wool, since English woolens were again being sold in American
markets. A bill for the aid of the manufacturers of
woolens was defeated in 1827 only by the vote of Vice President
Calhoun, who again showed the growth of his anti-protection
views. Then followed a convention of protectionists at
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which advocated very high duties
(1827). The adherents of Jackson, whose candidacy was kept
shrewdly before the public throughout Adams’s term, now conceived
a very subtle plan for helping their hero and still further
discrediting Adams. They proposed to levy exorbitant duties
on raw products,—a policy which would secure the favor of the
Western farmers and sheep-raisers, but would outrage the New
England manufacturers. The latter, it was thought, would
then join the Southerners in defeating the bill and would owe
no gratitude to Adams. Jackson would in consequence keep
his Southern votes, yet would also seem friendly to the West
and to the protectionists generally. The schemes of Jackson’s
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
partisans to increase his chances of election were unnecessary,
since he was already a sufficiently popular candidate. The bill
actually passed laid high duties which protected both growers
of raw products<a id='r149'/><a href='#f149' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[149]</span></sup></a> and manufacturers. Although the gains of
the manufacturers were thus neutralized, they thought it best
to take their chances under the increased duties. Accordingly
the congressmen who represented them voted for the bill, and
Adams signed it May 24, 1828. The South was greatly outraged
in consequence, although some of her own leaders had
with sinister purpose forced the rates up.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s341'></a><span class='bold'>341. South Carolina’s Discontent.</span>—South Carolina was especially
excited. Her feelings and ideas were well expressed in
a document—the celebrated “Exposition and Protest”—drawn
up by Calhoun. In this manifesto the Vice President,
following the lead of his predecessor Jefferson, pushed the
doctrine of state protest, as outlined in the Kentucky and Virginia
Resolutions, to the extreme of a separate state veto and
nullification of an obnoxious law (§ <a href='#s279'>279</a>). He went farther than
Jefferson, however, his views being derived partly from his own
philosophical speculations, partly from the teachings of John
Randolph and of other Southern leaders. The consequences of
the adoption of his theory were plainly very dangerous, but
matters stood still for a while, since all parties were waiting to
see what stand the new administration to be inaugurated in
1829 would take with regard to the tariff.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s342'></a><span class='bold'>342. Election of 1828.</span>—As might have been foreseen, Adams
was defeated in the election of 1828. He had come nearer
success than was expected; for the votes of New York and
Pennsylvania would have turned the scale. But his opponents,
with their scandalous stories, their unnecessary congressional
investigations, their general unscrupulousness, had
been too much for him. Clay had not been efficient in directing
the campaign; while Jackson had secured in his favor what he
had not had in the campaign of 1824,—the support of the
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
skillful group of New York politicians known as the “Albany
Regency,” at the head of which was the astute Martin Van
Buren. Besides, Jackson’s views on disputed questions were
a mystery, so that he could be claimed by any faction, while his
sympathies and qualities were plainly democratic and thus
acceptable to the masses. On the other hand, Adams’s views
were so pronounced that he was sure to alienate votes, and his
sympathies and qualities were plainly aristocratic.<a id='r150'/><a href='#f150' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[150]</span></sup></a> Finally,
Jackson was a typical Westerner, and the West then held the
balance of power. It is no wonder, therefore, that in the
popular vote he distanced his rival.</p>

John Randolph, probably the most venomously personal debater Congress
has ever had among its members, gave immortality to the charge against
Adams and Clay by likening the pair to two unsavory characters in Fielding’s
novel, <span class='it'>Tom Jones</span>. He referred to the “coalition of Blifil and Black George,
a combination, unheard of until now, of the Puritan and the blackleg.” The
taunt against Clay expressed in the last word was based upon that statesman’s
rather loose habits, which were only too characteristic of the public
men of the period. The fact that Randolph and Clay fought a bloodless duel
over this matter, reminds us of the extent to which manners have changed
within three quarters of a century.</p>

<h3 id='s343a'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>POLITICAL CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s343'></a><span class='bold'>343. The Meaning of Jackson’s Election.</span>—Andrew Jackson
was the first man of plain birth and breeding to sit in the White
House. Born on the border between the two Carolinas, he had
early made his way to Tennessee and there had risen to leadership
through his strength of character and his possession of all
the manly qualities most held in repute by the pioneer settlers.
The democratic voters gave him whatever political or military
offices he wanted, and were thoroughly satisfied with the effective
way he discharged his duties. When Indians or British
threatened the South or Southwest, he was the man to whom
the general government had to turn, and his constant success
made him a popular hero throughout the Union. Thus, in
reputation as well as in character, he became more than a mere
Tennesseean; he became a representative American. He was
not a trained statesman, and his opinions on many important
subjects were little more than prejudices. But he was
thoroughly honest and fearless and precisely the sort of leader
fitted to enlist the sympathy and admiration of the democracy.
It is true that he could have done little without his shrewd
political friends, and that he was likely to be partly their tool.
It is true, also, that with all the virtues of the backwoodsmen,
he had some of their vices, notably that of vindictiveness.
But when all allowances are made, he was a great man, thoroughly
representative of the new electorate.
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s344'></a><span class='bold'>344. The New Democracy.</span>—The new type of politicians
controlling the country was but an index of a new electorate.
In the East the downfall of the Federalists and the constant
extensions of the suffrage had created a party of “the people,”
which would have had little chance of making its wishes law
under the régime of Washington, or even of Jefferson. But
it hailed in Jackson a leader after its own heart. In the
West, where aristocracy was practically unknown, no other
party had ever existed, and the young communities had long
chafed under the conservative methods of the East, which advanced
one Secretary of State after another to the Presidential
chair. In the South the planters still controlled affairs, but
they treated the democracy with consideration, and directed,
rather than thwarted, its energies. Of course, in developing
this new political force, the teachings of Jefferson and his
school had had much influence; but the growth and spread of
population, the increase of territory, the development of means
of communication, and the opening up of new industries had
been more effective. Jefferson had wanted to have the people
recognized as the source of power, but he wished to have educated
men use the power thus obtained. He thought, moreover,
that tyranny would be averted if these picked men represented
localities, or states, which would be jealous of their rights, and
not the nation at large, which would not be thus jealous. The
new democracy, on the other hand, while suspicious of strong
government, was national in its sympathies, rather than local, as
was soon proved by Jackson. The lately formed states of the
West, being all younger than the Union, many of them creations
by that Union out of national territory, had less state pride than
the older commonwealths which had formed the Union. The
new conditions of trade were, moreover, somewhat obliterating
state lines in the North and East by inducing travel and
correspondence on the part of business men. Thus the local
democracy represented by Jefferson was being more and more
confined to the South, but it kept up an alliance with the
national and more radical democracy represented by Jackson
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
down to the Civil War. Manhood suffrage, dependence of office
holders upon the wishes of the electorate, and other principles
of the Jacksonian democracy have become the political heritage
of Americans, regardless of party.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s345'></a><span class='bold'>345. Changes among the People.</span>—The new democracy was
strong and honest, but very ignorant. It was controlled by
clever politicians, who used the machinery of caucus, primary
election, and nominating conventions, and also introduced the
ideas of the supreme virtue of party fealty, and of the propriety
of distributing the spoils of office to the victors in each successive
election. In other words, men were being taught to distrust
their individual judgment and to trust that of their party.
These ideas were held in all honesty, and few persons had time
to consider whither they would lead. Few saw that party
loyalty was taking the place of patriotism, that desire for the
gains of office was supplanting the spirit of patriotic self-sacrifice.
The country had grown tremendously in area, in
population, and in wealth. Steamers were running in every
direction, and railroads were soon to be built. Religious and
educational lethargy had been shaken, and new ideas were in the
air. National democracy, with its theories of the right of all
to aspire to office, and its businesslike way of rewarding its
successful supporters, was itself, therefore, a part of a great
transformation of three-fourths of the American people.</p>

<h3 id='s346a'>PROGRESS OF THE NATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s346'></a><span class='bold'>346. Growth of the Nation.</span>—It is difficult to realize the
extent of this transformation. In 1789 Spain hemmed us in
to the South and West and the British had not abandoned
fortresses that belonged to us in the Northwest. Just beyond
the Alleghanies the Indians were still a menace. Forty years
later our domain stretched far beyond the Mississippi, Spain
had yielded Florida, and Great Britain respected our rights.
The Seminoles in Florida, and other tribes in the far West,
were still to give trouble, but everywhere the wigwam was
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
retreating before the log cabin. A generation before, the Atlantic
seaboard had dominated the country in population, education,
and wealth. Now the West was, not indeed the equal of
the East, but a formidable rival. Since the War of 1812, the
migration to Northwest and Southwest had been marvelous.
The people seemed determined to fill up their more than
two million square miles of territory. Emigrants from Europe
had not begun to come over in great numbers, but American
families were large and always ready to move to a favorable
locality, especially from rugged New England to the fertile
West. Improved roads, canals, and steamboats facilitated the
movement of population, but even in the South, where roads
were bad, enterprising families moved by thousands from Virginia
and the Carolinas into Alabama and Mississippi, which
with their rich lands invited the cotton planter and his slaves.
Under these circumstances it is no wonder that by 1830 the
population of the country had reached nearly thirteen millions,
and that eleven new states had been added to the old thirteen.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s347'></a><span class='bold'>347. Material and Moral Progress.</span>—Perhaps the greatest
change that had taken place in America was the increased
mental and moral energy displayed by its inhabitants. The
people were still provincial, but they were no longer sluggish.
The War of 1812 had developed their national spirit; their
own growth in population, and their acquisitions of territory,
out of which wealth in all forms could be easily extracted, had
developed their desire to prosper. They were no longer content
slowly to grow moderately rich. They fostered manufactures
and commerce and agriculture. They became a nation of
inventors, and, what was more important, they developed a
capacity for pure science which made the name of America
honored throughout the world. Out of their midst sprang
essayists and novelists and poets who interpreted their life to
them. There was a notable growth of the religious spirit;
temperance and other reforms were agitated; more attention
was paid to education; public charities of all kinds received
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
popular support. Nor were minor things overlooked. Men
of all classes began to strive to provide household comforts
for their families. Travel was made more comfortable. Good
hotels began to replace bad inns. Urban life did not attract
country people as it does now, but the towns had grown and
prospered. New York was in 1830 a city of two hundred
thousand inhabitants. Philadelphia was not far behind. Cincinnati
had grown from a mere village to a town of nearly
twenty-five thousand people. Throughout the North, East, and
West, therefore, the watchword was “Development.” Even in
the South, which was rendered conservative and sluggish by
the presence of slavery, there were not wanting proofs that
many energetic men would like to imitate their more fortunate
brothers of other sections. Like the rest of the country, the
South hoped for great things from her future railroads and
canals, but her industrial future was still far in the distance.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s348'></a><span class='bold'>348. Political Conditions.</span>—Although the East and North
led the rest of the country in manufacturing and commerce,
and although the West was developing agriculture to a great
degree, political power had not passed to them as completely
as a casual observer might have perhaps expected. The South
might be conservative, but it had an immense source of wealth
in its cotton; and buying, as it did, many supplies from the
North, it was a customer not to be offended. Hence many
Northern politicians opposed Southern schemes less violently
than they would otherwise have done, and hence the South
seemed to have disproportionate power at Washington. Besides,
Southern planters had more leisure to think of politics
than busier citizens elsewhere, and their emotional temperaments
naturally inclined them to political leadership. But
they were being more and more outnumbered every year in the
House of Representatives, and the Missouri Controversy had
shown them how increasingly difficult it would be to keep the
Senate balanced between free and slave states. In view of
their perilous position, they naturally became all the more
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
domineering and haughty in their demands. This, however,
roused the temper of the other sections. Wealthy New England
had time and means to develop the philanthropic spirit, and
an anti-slavery movement was sure to follow. The Northwest,
settled largely by New Englanders, would take this movement
up, although hampered by the presence of Southern immigrants
in Indiana and Illinois. It was impossible either for
the descendants of the Puritans or for the hardy pioneers to
tolerate long the domination of an aristocracy based on slavery.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s349'></a><span class='bold'>349. The New West.</span>—The Western man, especially, living
in his log cabin, pursuing the primitive unconventional life of
a farmer, could not sympathize with an aristocracy that did
not work with its hands, and must sympathize with slaves that
did. The graces of Southern social life counted for little with
Puritan or pioneer, and when the fight was begun the moral
enthusiasm of the one, and the shrewd sense, plain morality,
and superb energy of the other, would insure the victory for
freedom. The election of Jackson, who, although partly a
Southerner, was more a Westerner, meant, therefore, not
merely the triumph of a new democracy, but that the center
of political power had crossed the Alleghanies, and that the
control which the South had exercised over the Union from the
first was passing to stronger hands.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s350'></a><span class='bold'>350. Changes in New England.</span>—In New England, also, the
spirit of understanding which had long existed with the South
on account partly of trade connections, partly of the English
homogeneity common to both sections, was rapidly passing
away. The old New England of farmers and sailors was now
becoming more and more a country of manufacturers and
artisans. The old Puritan leaven still fermented,—not as
formerly, within the churches, the power of which had conspicuously
declined, but in new forms of philanthropy, philosophy,
and literature. New England had always been a power
in the intellectual life of the nation, but from 1830 to 1860 this
power was vastly increased. From her midst came abolitionists
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
like Garrison<a id='r151'/><a href='#f151' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[151]</span></sup></a> and others shortly to be mentioned. In
Webster she had the greatest of orators and of exponents of
the national idea. In
Ralph Waldo Emerson
(1803–1882) she had a
teacher of high morality
and a philosopher
who, if vague, like
his fellow-members of
the school known as
Transcendental, possessed,
nevertheless,
an inspiring personality.
In the elder
William Ellery Channing
(1780–1842) and
Theodore Parker<a id='r152'/><a href='#f152' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[152]</span></sup></a> she
had clergymen whose
influence was felt far
beyond their section.
In Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow (1807–1882)
she had the sweetest and most popular of native poets;
and in John Greenleaf Whittier (1807–1892), a sturdy poet-champion
of human liberty. James Russell Lowell (1819–1891),
too, was a young son of Massachusetts who, as poet
and critic, was to do good work for the nation. All these
great men were, more or less, forces to be counted against the
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
continued dominance of the South in politics. With the exception
of Webster they were not politicians, but they were
thinkers who taught others to think. Against them the South,
even with the poet and story writer, Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849),
could set no such galaxy of genius, save in the sphere of
politics; and with the exception of Calhoun, the Southern statesmen
of the new generation were inferior to those of the old.
Nor were the Middle states,
rich and populous though
they were, capable of competing
with New England as
a factor in the nation’s life.
Able politicians and editors
were coming to the front, and
there were some authors of
great power, such as James
Fenimore Cooper (1789–1851)
and Washington Irving
(1783–1859), but none capable
of supplying such civic
inspiration as writers like
Emerson and Whittier.
William Cullen Bryant
(1794–1878) might be counted
in this connection, for he
did his main work in New York, but he was New England
born. In short, it may be fairly said that New England represented
for the generation before the Civil War the progressive,
moral sense of the nation in the great question of freedom
versus slavery; for that portion of the West which served the
cause of liberty was settled chiefly by New England people.
Curiously enough, the greatest imaginative genius that New
England produced, Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804–1864), the
romancer, took little interest in the burning question of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s351'></a><span class='bold'>351. The Spoils System.</span>—Jackson’s inauguration was a signal
for crowds of his active supporters to hasten to Washington
for their rewards. At the reception at the White House they
displayed the rudeness of a mob, and furnished a sharp contrast
with the stately levees held by Washington in New York.
But worse things were to follow. Through a Tenure of Office
Act, due to Crawford (1820), many positions fell vacant every
four years. These vacancies enabled the President’s advisers
partly to satisfy the demands made upon him, but the politicians
also induced him to use his power of removal. In a few
months over five times as many changes were made in the civil
service as had been made by all Jackson’s predecessors. As a
matter of course these wholesale removals from office brought
many incompetent men into positions of trust, but it is quite
clear that Jackson did not realize what he was doing. He
thought he was rewarding faithful friends instead of inflicting
a disgrace and an incalculable injury upon his country. He
was a kind-hearted man, but some of the official changes that
he made on the advice of his political managers could scarcely
have been more cruel if he had been really merciless.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s352'></a><span class='bold'>352. Jackson’s Cabinet.</span>—Jackson’s Cabinet was chosen upon
the basis of friendship or service and was mediocre in character.
Van Buren,<a id='r153'/><a href='#f153' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[153]</span></sup></a> who was made Secretary of State, had ability,
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
it is true, and showed it conspicuously in the way he humored
Jackson in order to secure the Presidential succession. Two
Secretaries were friends of Calhoun, the Vice President, who
had thus far supported Jackson. Within three years, however,
the Cabinet
was, with one exception,
reconstituted.
This very
unusual and autocratic
procedure
of Jackson’s was
owing partly to
the alienation from
Calhoun which followed
Jackson’s
discovery that the
South Carolinian
had wished to have
him punished for
his high-handed
conduct in Florida
(§ <a href='#fn141'>324, note 2</a>), and
partly to the unwillingness
of the
wives of the other
Secretaries to call upon the wife of the Secretary of War. This
change in the personnel of the Cabinet but slightly affected the
character of the administration, since Jackson rarely consulted
his constitutional advisers, but preferred to take the advice of
a small group of friends known as the “Kitchen Cabinet.”
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
These men, chief among whom were William B. Lewis, an old
Tennessee neighbor, and Amos Kendall, later Postmaster-General,
acted as “coaches” to the old warrior. But the daring
and energy needed for carrying out certain of his policies
were furnished by himself.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s353'></a><span class='bold'>353. Jackson’s Autocratic Reign.</span>—Jackson, in spite of his
theories about the duty of an executive to do the people’s will,
was too much accustomed to command to be able to play the
part of a constitutional President with any grace. When he had
made up his mind to do a thing there was no stopping him. Of
all our Presidents he, the most typically democratic, with the
exception of Andrew Johnson, was the most typical autocrat.
Opponents called him “King Andrew” and his two administrations
are often spoken of as the “Reign of Andrew Jackson.”
Yet to his credit be it said, that when he was not persuaded
to act spitefully, he always acted fairly and for what he
believed to be the interests of the nation. He bullied Mexico,
but he would not be bullied by South Carolina. He insulted
Chief Justice Marshall, was unforgiving to Calhoun, but was
loyal to Van Buren. He was stern when his resolution to
act was kindled; yet at times he was remarkably gentle.
Almost the only time his will was successfully crossed was
when the women of Washington refused to receive Secretary
Eaton’s wife. But in describing him thus we are evidently
dealing with a real man, not with a mere personification of
the nation’s dignity. The history of Jackson’s administrations
is the biography of Jackson himself—a fact which
shows us that republican governments are sometimes as
much affected by personal influences as monarchies are.
The parallel between his career and that of a typical autocratic
ruler is drawn still closer when we remember that
an attempt was made to assassinate him. But this parallel
must not be pushed too far. No man ever more truly
wished to serve the people that elected him than Andrew
Jackson.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s354'></a><span class='bold'>354. Jackson as an Administrator.</span>—Jackson’s administrations
form a turning point in our history and are important
from almost every point of view. Only their leading features
can be treated here, but it may be well to say that whenever
he could,—as in the matter
of internal improvements,—Jackson
played
the part of a strict constructionist.
When it was
agreeable to him, he favored
state sovereignty, as
when he refused to support
Chief Justice Marshall and
the Supreme Court in their
decisions against Georgia,
which state continued to
act toward the Cherokees
as badly as it had done
toward the Creeks. Georgia
officials treated Marshall
with contempt, and
Jackson is reported to have
said, “John Marshall has made his law, now let him enforce
it.” Such a divorce between the executive and the judiciary,
if long continued, would mean anarchy; but it must be remembered
that Jackson, an old backwoodsman, would of course sympathize
with the white men of Georgia.<a id='r154'/><a href='#f154' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[154]</span></sup></a> But he would tolerate
no violation of national laws which he thought it right to defend,
and he considered the voice of the people sufficient authority
for some very loose constructions of the Constitution.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s355'></a><span class='bold'>355. The Webster-Hayne Debate.</span>—Probably the most striking
event of Jackson’s first administration is the great debate
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
of 1830 between Webster<a id='r155'/><a href='#f155' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[155]</span></sup></a> and Hayne. It grew out
of some resolutions of Senator Foote of Connecticut with
regard to the rapid sales
of public lands. The
cheapness of land drew
population westward, and
this raised the price of
labor in the older states;
hence the interest of New
England seemed to lie in
opposing the policy of
granting portions of the
public domain to newcomers
on very easy
terms. The resolutions
were hotly opposed by
Senator Thomas H. Benton<a id='r156'/><a href='#f156' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[156]</span></sup></a>
of Missouri, a leading
supporter of Jackson.
Benton and all Westerners
naturally thought
the prevailing policy wise
because it brought men and money to the new commonwealths.
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
Senator Robert Y. Hayne<a id='r157'/><a href='#f157' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[157]</span></sup></a> of South Carolina came to the help
of the Western men, since to most Southerners New England
was now obnoxious on account
of the Tariff of Abominations
(§ <a href='#s340'>340</a>), and since
the West, being comparatively
unsettled, might, they
thought, possibly be won to
slavery’s side. Webster replied
to Hayne, and the latter
returned to the attack, but on
a different line. He discussed
the nature of the general
government and gave warning
that if the South were
not relieved of tariff burdens,
the remedy of a state
veto would have to be resorted
to. In other words,
he advanced Calhoun’s doctrine
of nullification, which,
as we have seen, was an extension of the principles enunciated
by Virginia and Kentucky in 1798, and by the Hartford
Convention in 1814 (§§ <a href='#s279'>279</a> and <a href='#s315'>315</a>). Webster replied in
his most famous speech, and as an orator certainly got the
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
better of his opponent, although Hayne’s defense of his
own position was masterly. Even Calhoun himself, who, as
he was serving his second term as Vice President, could
not join in the debate, would hardly have presented his
own views more clearly. Whether Webster eclipsed Hayne
as a political reasoner, is a point on which the North and
the South have never been in perfect agreement. Webster
denied Hayne’s postulate that the Union rested on a compact,
and affirmed that the Constitution had established a general
government with powers sufficient to enforce its rights even
against the component states.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Daniel Webster’s Carriage.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s356'></a><span class='bold'>356. The Theoretical and the Historical View.</span>—Few will
now deny that Webster was right as a theoretical publicist,
for a constitution which
admitted the right of
secession or of nullification
would have framed
a farcical government.
But whether he was right
from the point of view
of the constitutional lawyer
or of the historical
annalist is quite a different
matter. There were
nationalists from the beginning,
but it seems
probable that most men
in 1789 believed that the
Constitution was a compact between the states. By 1830
the North, and much of the West, had been nationalized and
had more or less forgotten or abandoned the compact theory.
But the South, less changed, adhered to it, especially as on it
a minority party could base a constitutional resistance to an
obnoxious policy like the tariff. Hence it seems fair to conclude
that Webster was right as a publicist, partly unsound
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
as a lawyer and annalist; but that the future was with him,
the past with Hayne. That the past was with Hayne is
partly at least confirmed by the general historical fact that
minority parties, needing all the support they can get, make
a careful study of precedents and have every interest in not
making mistakes in their procedure. Parties of progress, on
the other hand, are rarely careful about their reasoning from
precedents. It is to be noted further that much of the political
strength the Southerners still possessed lay in the fact that
they were on the defensive and could obstruct legislation by
strictly construing the Constitution.</p>

<h3 id='s357a'>THE TARIFF AND NULLIFICATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s357'></a><span class='bold'>357. Jackson and Calhoun.</span>—Shortly after the debate it looked
as if South Carolina at least would put Calhoun’s theory in
operation. The tariff of 1828 had been reformed in 1830 and
in 1832, but the protective idea was still dominant, and against
this idea the Southerners were firmly set. They wished to resist
in some way, but they soon found that they could not count
on Jackson to help them as he had helped Georgia. That
old warrior had answered their overtures, when attending a
banquet given on Jefferson’s birthday, at which disunion sentiments
were openly expressed, by giving, as his contribution
to the entertainment, the toast, “Our Federal Union: it
must be preserved.” They could count on Calhoun, however,
with more certainty than ever, for his break with Jackson
took place about this time; and, so far as logical exposition
goes, no cause has ever had more remarkable support than
Calhoun gave the nullifiers. Jackson, however, received a
stronger support. He was reëlected in 1832 by a very large
majority and believed that the people meant him to go
ahead and preserve the Union, as well as to carry out other
important policies.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s358'></a><span class='bold'>358. Nullification.</span>—Meanwhile those South Carolinians who
thought as Calhoun did, in spite of considerable opposition from
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
their fellow-citizens, caused a State Convention to be assembled
in November, 1832. This body declared the tariff acts of 1828
and 1832 null and void so far as South Carolina was concerned,
and prohibited payment of duties under them after February
1, 1833. Jackson replied by a strong proclamation, which
urged the necessity of every true patriot’s supporting the
laws and officers of the Union. Unfortunately many good
South Carolinians thought that a patriot ought to support the
state first, and the Union afterward. Jackson, however, did
not rely on a mere proclamation. He dispatched soldiers
and vessels to Charleston, and asked Congress to pass a bill
enlarging his powers so that he might legally crush the
incipient revolution. Congress in reply passed what is known
as the Force Bill, March 1, 1833. No force was needed, however.
The other Southern states did not stand by South
Carolina, for although most of them believed in the right of
secession as a last resort, they had little sympathy with nullification.
They did not see how a state could remain in the
Union, and yet not obey the latter’s laws. The nullifiers,
under their leaders,—Hayne, who was now Governor of South
Carolina, and Calhoun, who had taken Hayne’s place in the
Senate,—had hoped for concession rather than war, and, pending
the action of Congress, suspended the nullification ordinance.
The administration, too, while determined to assert itself, had
no great interest in the protective system, the cause of the
quarrel. At this juncture Clay again played the part of a
compromiser, and a tariff act, providing for a gradual return
in ten years to the mild duties of 1816, was made law, March
2, 1833, one day after the Force Bill was passed and a day
before the obnoxious tariff of 1832 was to have gone into effect.
On their side, the South Carolinians held another convention,
and repealed their first nullifying ordinance, but nullified the
Force Bill. Thus it was practically a drawn battle—neither
side abandoning its principles, but both making concessions
in a not altogether brave and creditable way. As was to be
expected, both parties claimed a victory. In South Carolina
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
Calhoun’s influence grew steadily stronger, and the militia of
the state seems to have been kept up with the distinct idea
that it might be available in another crisis with the general
government. On the other hand, Jackson had maintained the
dignity of the Union, and the tariff compromisers, following the
Missouri compromisers, had succeeded in putting off the day
of reckoning until the Free states were strong enough to crush
slavery and still retain the Southern states in the Union.</p>

<h3 id='s359a'><span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>THE ABOLITIONISTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s359'></a><span class='bold'>359. Anti-slavery Agitation.</span>—The tariff was not destined
to remain the chief grievance of the Southerners. They were
soon far more concerned with the growing agitation against
slavery which was being waged by determined men and women
in the North. At the head of these abolitionists, as they were
styled, stood William Lloyd Garrison, who in 1831 established
his anti-slavery paper, <span class='it'>The Liberator</span>, in Boston. Up to this
time many leading Southerners, including Washington and
Jefferson, had deplored the existence of slavery without seeing
how to get rid of it. Now, feeling outraged by the attacks
made upon their section, and fearing other slave insurrections
like one incited by Nat Turner in Virginia in 1831, they
began to defend their institution as a property right secured
to them by law, and a profitable one in view of the increased
demand for cotton. Efforts for emancipation, such as those
made by representatives of the mountain districts of Virginia,
in a convention held in that state in 1829–1830, were abandoned.
A pro-slavery literature was produced, which treated slavery not
as an evil to be abated, but as a benefit to be spread. Stricter
penal laws were enacted with regard to the blacks, and the abolitionists
were denounced and threatened. The latter received
at first similar treatment in the North, where they were frequently
mobbed. They continued to make proselytes, however,
and by 1836 had put the nation in a turmoil, as a result
of their petitions to Congress for the abolition of slavery in
the District of Columbia.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s360'></a><span class='bold'>360. Abolitionist Petitions to Congress.</span>—The Southerners,
alarmed at the thought of the bad effects upon their interests
that debate on these petitions might have, secured the passage
of resolutions tabling them. But they found it hard to silence
such an advocate as John Quincy Adams, who had not disdained
to serve his country in the House of Representatives
after having held the highest
office open to a citizen.
Adams was not an abolitionist,
but he did believe
in the right of all citizens
to petition Congress, and
until his death, in 1848, he
championed the cause of
liberty in the most eloquent
way. Soon, too, the
Southerners had the difficult
task of disposing of
the abolitionist pamphlets
sent through the mails.
As a result of their efforts
to suppress freedom of
speech and kindred rights,
the cause they were opposing
gained in strength. It had its martyr in E. P. Lovejoy,
murdered in Alton, Illinois, in 1837, and its fiery orator in
Wendell Phillips<a id='r158'/><a href='#f158' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[158]</span></sup></a> of Boston. It had the future with it
also, but this only the more far-sighted of the Southerners
could see. The mass of them saw only that an institution
bequeathed to them by their fathers and, as they believed,
essential to their comfort and prosperity, was being assailed
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
by men who, as a rule, had had little close contact with it. In
consequence, they naturally made the best resistance they
could. They would have been more than human if they had
not resisted, but it must be confessed that their speeches
and actions were often so extreme in character as to defeat
their ends. On the other hand, the abolitionists were partly
responsible, in their turn, for the extreme stand taken by the
Southerners, for they were very intemperate in their strictures.
Because they abhorred slavery, they thought it logical to abhor
slaveholders and the Constitution of the United States, which
permitted slavery. They were opposed to all efforts to settle
the slavery question by political action. They upheld every
kind of reform, no matter how extreme, and were continually
at loggerheads among themselves. In other words, they were
impractical, and their methods in the early years of the agitation
were abhorrent to the average American citizen. Nevertheless,
they aroused the public conscience on the subject of
slavery, and, as leaders of a crusade, their most influential
members, men and women, have perhaps never been surpassed.</p>

<h3 id='s361a'>FINANCIAL DISTURBANCES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s361'></a><span class='bold'>361. Jackson and the Bank.</span>—Meanwhile Jackson, though on
the whole a Southern sympathizer, had a battle of his own to
fight that interested him far more than the slavery contest.
He had an agriculturist’s suspicion of capitalists, and in particular
saw in the Bank of the United States a greedy monopoly
worked in the interests of his political enemies.<a id='r159'/><a href='#f159' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[159]</span></sup></a> Accordingly
he early declared war against that institution, which was at
that time in good condition. Henry Clay, his chief rival, took
up the issue, and in 1832 had a bill passed for rechartering the
corporation. Jackson at once vetoed it, and the country sustained
him in the campaign of 1832, in which Henry Clay, as
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
candidate of the National Republicans,<a id='r160'/><a href='#f160' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[160]</span></sup></a> and William Wirt as
candidate of the short-lived party known as the Anti-Masons,<a id='r161'/><a href='#f161' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[161]</span></sup></a>
were ignominiously defeated.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s362'></a><span class='bold'>362. Removal of the Deposits.</span>—Encouraged by the popular
support he had received, and believing firmly, and rightly, it
would seem, that the bank was a dangerous monopoly, Jackson
now resolved to deal it a crushing blow. He secured, after
some trouble, a coöperating Secretary of the Treasury in Roger
B. Taney of Maryland, and through him had an order given for
the withdrawal of the deposits of public money in the bank
and its branches.<a id='r162'/><a href='#f162' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[162]</span></sup></a> This move might under other circumstances
have been a wise one, but it was made in an impolitic manner;
and by crippling the bank at a period when the nation was carried
away by a craze for speculation, it probably helped to
pave the way for the great financial panic of 1837. It also
brought upon Jackson a vote of censure by the Senate, which
he answered in a vigorous protest, and which his friends later,
under the lead of Benton, by a rather farcical procedure succeeded
in expunging from the <span class='it'>Senate Journal</span>.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s363'></a><span class='bold'>363. Censure of Jackson’s Action.</span>—Few actions of an American
President have been more harshly criticised than that
of Jackson toward the Bank of the United States, but it cost
him little of his popularity with the masses, because they, like
himself, were suspicious of corporate wealth. The wealthy
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
classes, however, denounced him freely, and with some reason.
The changes necessitated in his Cabinet in order that his wishes
might be carried out suited rather a self-willed sovereign like
Louis XIV. than the constitutional executive of a republic. The
vindictiveness with which he pursued his policy was appropriate
to a small, rather than a great, man. Besides, the whole matter
was one for financiers to manage, and Jackson knew more of
fighting than he did of finance. Nor was popular acquiescence
in his policy a sure indication of its wisdom. On the other
hand, the president of the bank, Nicholas Biddle, of Philadelphia,
acted with indiscretion and injured his own cause.
Clay also was premature in forcing the issue and had a partisan
purpose in doing it. The bank had years before been grossly mismanaged
(§ <a href='#fn137'>317, note</a>) and might be so again; and when its existence
was threatened, it used money in politics. Moreover, after
its charter expired, its career under the laws of Pennsylvania
was discreditable. Taking all these facts into consideration, we
are perhaps justified in concluding that Jackson’s methods of
procedure deserve great censure in spite of his integrity, but
that what he actually did was not nearly so detrimental to the
interests of the country as some persons have considered it.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s364'></a><span class='bold'>364. Banks and Speculation.</span>—But the end was not yet. The
funds removed from the Bank of the United States were deposited
in state banks, controlled by Democrats, and afterwards known
as “Jackson’s Pets.” This governmental favor caused the
numbers of such banks to increase, and thus stimulated the universal
desire to indulge in financial speculation. The public revenues
meanwhile increased through speculation in public lands
and through larger imports, and as the national debt had been
paid off shortly before, it was hard to decide what to do with
the accumulated funds. An outlet for this surplus was found
in non-interest-bearing loans to the states in proportion to their
representation in Congress. This distribution of the surplus—a
favorite project of Clay’s and destined later to complicate the
financial situation still more seriously—increased the tendency
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
toward extravagant internal improvements, and thus fed the
fever for speculation which, as we have just said, both supported
and was supported by a loose system of banking under state
control.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s365'></a><span class='bold'>365. Wild-cat Banks.</span>—The “Wild-cat Banks,” as the banks
established under this system were called, were especially numerous
in the South and West, and their paper notes were of such
varying values that the public suffered great inconvenience.<a id='r163'/><a href='#f163' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[163]</span></sup></a>
Journals were published for the special purpose of reporting
from day to day the value of the various issues and for the purpose
of pointing out how traders could avoid being deceived by
the numerous counterfeits. There was a legitimate demand for
an increase of the circulating medium, and the government had
tried to meet this by enlarging the output of gold and silver
coins and by arranging for notes to be issued by the deposit
banks on a specie reserve of one-third of their circulation. But
these measures were not sufficient. The states chartered banks
recklessly, and the banks issued their notes in wild profusion.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s366'></a><span class='bold'>366. The “Specie Circular.”</span>—Jackson became alarmed, since
the notes of even the specie-paying banks received by the
Treasury for the purchase of public lands were declining in
value. He therefore issued his famous “Specie Circular,” which
announced, against the advice of the Cabinet, that thenceforth
only gold and silver would be received in payment for public
lands. This order naturally affected the banks in the West
disastrously, forced back a mass of notes upon the East, and
induced a general want of confidence, which was all the greater
on account of the previous speculative want of caution.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s367'></a><span class='bold'>367. Election of Van Buren.</span>—Jackson, like Jefferson, however,
was fortunate enough to lay down his office in time to leave his
successor to meet the impending storm. That successor was
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
Martin Van Buren, who by the irony of fate had helped his chief
to secure two of his greatest successes. These were the opening
of the ports of the British West Indies to American ships, and
the acknowledgment by France of the justice of the French
spoliation claims, which were based on depredations committed
on American commerce during the Napoleonic régime.<a id='r164'/><a href='#f164' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[164]</span></sup></a> Still,
Van Buren partly deserved his fate, for he had been subservient
to Jackson and had succeeded him on the distinct pledge that he
would follow in his footsteps. He was the first real politician
to reach the White House, but he had statesmanly qualities
also. If he had not bound himself to Jackson so closely that
he was often forced to act against his own judgment, he would
probably rank among the greatest Presidents. But adherence
to Jackson’s policy—for example, in the bullying attitude assumed
toward Mexico on account of Texas—undoubtedly hurt
his career and perhaps his conscience. Still, Jackson had stood
by him after the Senate had unjustifiably failed to confirm his
appointment to the English mission; and, first as Vice President,
afterward as President, he had great cause to bless “Old
Hickory’s” friendship.</p>

<h3 id='s368a'><span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>A PERIOD OF CONFUSION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s368'></a><span class='bold'>368. New Parties.</span>—Martin Van Buren won the election of
1836 as a Democrat, for Jackson’s party, as we have seen, had
dropped the word “Republican” from their name (§ <a href='#fn159'>361, note 1</a>).
His opponent had been William Henry Harrison of Indiana, a
man long prominent in his section (§§ <a href='#s299'>299</a>, <a href='#s302'>302</a>, <a href='#s305'>305</a>). Harrison
was the nominee of the Whigs, but the real leaders of the latter
party were Clay and Webster. The chief bond of union binding
the two leaders and their followers together was their desire for
a liberal construction of the Constitution and for a strong central
government. The Whigs were soon destined to develop
strength in every section, even in the South.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s369'></a><span class='bold'>369. The Independent Treasury.</span>—Van Buren and the Democrats
were destined soon to lose the strength they began with.
The panic of 1837 greatly injured business, and then, as they
have so often since done, men blamed the central government for
a state of things for which it was only partly responsible. Banks
failed in every direction and prices went up enormously, flour
and corn more than doubling in cost. The President called an
extra session of Congress to consider the situation, but had little
to propose besides insisting on the policy of the “Specie Circular”
and on divorcing the government from the banks. The
latter policy, known as the Independent Treasury system or
Sub-Treasury, was finally carried through in 1840. With a
slight intermission, it has been the policy of the nation ever
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
since. Its main features are the receipt and disbursement of
government funds at vaults built in a few of the chief cities.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s370'></a><span class='bold'>370. Van Buren’s Failure.</span>—The administration’s policy did
little to mend matters, and the people rightly or wrongly attributed
most of the financial troubles of the time to Jackson’s
meddling with the banks. They accordingly listened to the
Whigs, who believed in a national bank in particular and in
discrediting the Democrats in general. To make matters worse
for Van Buren, the spoils system began to show its seamy side,
and he was accused of all its evils, unjustly, on the whole. He
was also charged with living in luxury while the poor were starving,
and in the midst of the panic was almost menaced by a mob
in the White House grounds. Furthermore, he alienated many
persons by not siding with the Canadian revolutionists of 1837,
and by not encouraging the annexation of Texas, which had
revolted from Mexico in 1836. Even the Seminole War,<a id='r165'/><a href='#f165' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[165]</span></sup></a> continued
for several years against the Indians of Florida, was
charged against him; and, in 1840, although he had on the whole
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
governed well, he was overwhelmingly defeated by General Harrison
in a campaign conducted on sensational lines.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s371'></a><span class='bold'>371. Campaign of 1840.</span>—Although Harrison was a Whig,
the candidate for Vice President who was associated with
him, John Tyler
of Virginia, was
chosen chiefly because
he had
opposed Jackson.
He was really a
Jeffersonian Democrat,
not a Whig.
Principles were
little in demand,
the voters being
satisfied with spectacular
demonstrations.
In their
torchlight processions
they carried
around large, log
cabins with men
in front drinking
cider—visible insignia
of the frontiersmen,
to which class Harrison was supposed to belong.
They also shouted their campaign refrain of “Tippecanoe
and Tyler too” (§ <a href='#s299'>299</a>), and they held monster meetings in
the open air. No campaign in American history has been
more marked by noisy, unreasoning enthusiasm than this.</p>

<h3 id='s372a'>THE EMBARRASSMENTS OF THE WHIGS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s372'></a><span class='bold'>372. Tyler’s Position.</span>—General Harrison<a id='r166'/><a href='#f166' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[166]</span></sup></a> was an old man,
and proved unable to bear the strain of his campaign, the pressure
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
of office seekers, and the ceremonies attending his inauguration.
He died exactly one month after taking office, and left his
party in great confusion. Vice President John Tyler, his successor,
did not believe in the Whig policy of loose construction,
and was a Democrat in all except a few particulars. He soon
showed his colors by vetoing Clay’s bill for a national bank, and
then vetoing a second bill framed on suggestions of his own.
He was accused of bad faith, but was doubtless only in a false
position and anxious to assert a policy of his own that might
put him at the head of a party. His vetoes, however, made the
Whigs his deadly enemies and caused all his Cabinet to resign
except Webster. The latter, as Secretary of State, remained to
settle with the British Minister, Lord Ashburton, in the treaty
that bears the latter’s name (1842), the disputed northeastern
boundary and certain points connected with the suppression
of the African slave trade.<a id='r167'/><a href='#f167' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[167]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s373'></a><span class='bold'>373. The Lesson of Tyler’s Career.</span>—John Tyler<a id='r168'/><a href='#f168' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[168]</span></sup></a> was the first
Vice President to reach the White House through the death
of his superior. His behavior in the higher office should have
taught the people of the United States a lesson as to the necessity
of choosing highly qualified candidates for the Vice
Presidential office. The career of Andrew Johnson proves
that they had not learned this lesson in 1864. The old
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
system by which the candidate receiving the second highest
number of electoral votes became Vice President had its drawbacks,
but it at least gave the country such Vice Presidents as
John Adams and Jefferson. Under the new system the office
has been too often
given to a candidate
possessing
political influence
or to a good man
so old as to be
likely to die before
the expiration
of his term.
It follows that
Tyler is not so
much to blame
for his mistakes
as the people who
put him where
he was sure to
go astray. He
was an honest
and amiable man,
who by no means
lacked capacity.
He helped Webster in the Ashburton Treaty. He behaved
with discretion during what is known as “Dorr’s Rebellion”
in Rhode Island<a id='r169'/><a href='#f169' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[169]</span></sup></a> (1841–1842). But, on the whole, Tyler was
lacking in discretion and was unable to take the lead in public
matters. He did not believe in a national bank and was perhaps
right in not doing so; but if he had been wise, he would
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
have said so plainly and thus prevented the Whigs passing
bills that he was sure to veto. He vetoed other measures besides
the bank bills and perhaps again was in the right; but
the main result of his actions was to earn for him the distrust
both of the Whigs and of the Democrats. His attempt to form
a party of his own was a complete failure.</p>

<h3 id='s374a'>TEXAS AND OREGON.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Samuel Houston.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s374'></a><span class='bold'>374. The Texas Question.</span>—The congressional election at the
middle of Tyler’s term, while adverse to the Whigs, did not help
him. The second half
of his administration
was therefore even
more wanting in harmony
and effectiveness
than the first.
The chief question
put forward was the
admission of Texas,
which the President,
as a Southern man
and a sympathizer
with slavery, naturally
favored. Although
Mexico had
not recognized her
independence, Texas
had now been a republic
ever since
General Samuel
Houston<a id='r170'/><a href='#f170' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[170]</span></sup></a> had defeated
the Mexican
leader, Santa Anna, at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. The leading
Texans were Americans, however, and desired annexation,
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
but this would mean not only war with Mexico, but also a huge
increase of territory for slavery. Accordingly Northern men
shrank from allowing the annexation of the sparsely populated
region. Anti-slavery sentiments were growing, and such able
men as Joshua R. Giddings of Ohio were championing them
in Congress. But the Southerners were alert also, especially
Calhoun, who became Tyler’s Secretary of State toward the
end of his term. Calhoun feared that England was anxious
to secure Texas; besides, he felt that slavery must spread
or be crushed out. It was not hard to induce Tyler to join
in negotiations with the Texans, and in April, 1844, a treaty
of annexation, secretly prepared, was announced. It was defeated
in the Senate by a large vote, but was taken up as the
chief issue of the next campaign.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s375'></a><span class='bold'>375. The Campaign of 1844.</span>—The Whigs put up Clay, and the
Democrats chose James K. Polk<a id='r171'/><a href='#f171' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[171]</span></sup></a> of Tennessee, since Van Buren
would not advocate annexation. Polk, although he had been
previously Speaker of the House, was not very well known and
had aspired only to the Vice Presidency. He was therefore
really the first “dark horse” to receive a presidential nomination.
Clay, on the other hand, was a veteran statesman, the
natural nominee of his party. But Clay unfortunately wrote
letters that made his position on the Texas question ambiguous;
he therefore lost the support of many anti-slavery
men, who, as the “Liberty Party,” put up a candidate of their
own. Polk was accordingly elected over a competitor much
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
his superior. But before the newly elected President took his

the Democrats had made the question of the occupation of
Oregon a cardinal issue in their campaign. Their success led
them to claim that the United States must have all the territory
lying south of 54° 40′, “or fight.” This demand was in
every sense a rash one, and might easily have brought on war
with Great Britain, but it fortunately led to no evil results.
In 1846 a treaty with Great Britain fixed the American
northern line at the 49° parallel, and only Mexico was left to
contend against.</p>

This war, which originated in the attempt of the general government to
transfer the Florida Indians beyond the Mississippi River, lasted seven years
(1835–1842), and cost many lives and millions of dollars. It was easy to disperse
the savages in open fight, but when they took to the swamps, soldiers
were almost useless, and the best generals tried their skill in vain. Finally,
after much damage had been done by the banditti, so that immigration
into Florida was greatly checked, the policy of giving lands to settlers who
would carry arms to defend themselves was tried successfully. The leading
spirit of the Seminoles was Osceola, an able warrior, who was finally captured
while he was holding a conference under a flag of truce. It was asserted
that he did not respect his own engagements, and that this was the only way
to take him, but one does not like to dwell upon the occurrence. Shortly
before, an Indian war, known as the Black Hawk War, from the name of the
chief of the Sac and Fox tribes who conducted it, had been brought to a conclusion
after a considerable amount of fighting. This war, like that with the
Seminoles, was due to the efforts of the government to remove across the
Mississippi the tribes lingering in Illinois and Wisconsin. Some of the Indians
went peaceably, but Black Hawk, who had previously come under the influence
of Tecumseh, induced many warriors to resist. Finally, in the summer
of 1832, the regular troops of the United States defeated them on the Wisconsin
and the Bad Axe rivers, and Black Hawk and his two sons, with a few
warriors, were taken to Fortress Monroe and there confined for a short period.</p>

Tyler and Calhoun had at first thought that the passage of a treaty which
would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate, was the proper method of annexation.
On the failure of this treaty they took up a suggestion made during
the congressional debates and pressed the passage of a joint resolution, which
required only a majority of both houses. Such a change was especially curious
on the part of strict constructionists.</p>

<h3 id='s377a'><span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>THE OPENING OF THE MEXICAN WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s377'></a><span class='bold'>377. The Issues Involved.</span>—As a Mexican state, Texas had
extended on the south and west to the river Nueces; but her
inhabitants and the United States insisted on holding to
boundaries based on the Louisiana Purchase and on claiming
the “country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande.” The
Mexicans resisted this claim; and when Polk ordered General
Taylor to cross the Nueces, and later to advance to the Rio
Grande, they attacked and defeated a small body of the American
troops (April 24, 1846). Polk at once sent a message to
Congress, in which he declared that war existed, “through the
act of Mexico herself.” This statement was, on the whole, unwarranted,
although a technical defense was easily made for it.
It was really a case of a strong nation’s bullying a weak one;
and, as we have seen (§ <a href='#s353'>353</a>), the bullying had begun under
Jackson and had been steadily carried on. But Congress, and
a considerable portion of the people, especially in the South,
accepted Polk’s proposition, and the war was effectively prosecuted.
Its results were probably beneficial, in the main, since
the territory was sure to become American some day; but its
origin is not a pleasant topic for the patriotic American to
dwell upon. Nor is it by any means certain that the Civil
War was not in large part precipitated by that against Mexico.
The latter contest gave the South a taste for fighting that was
not altogether a warrant for the future calm of that section;
and the additional territory acquired by the Union opened a
new and disastrous phase of the slavery question (§§ <a href='#s388'>388</a>, <a href='#s411'>411</a>).

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s378'></a><span class='bold'>378. Conduct of the Administration.</span>—Senator Benton was
probably right when he claimed, in his <span class='it'>Thirty Years’ View</span>,
that there never was a less warlike administration than that of
Polk. Polk was thoroughly upright and pious, but was scarcely
broad-minded. He took his seat with the intention of
carrying out a programme the main feature of which was the
acquisition of California.
This programme
he carried out to the
letter, partly because
it was a popular one,
partly because he had
considerable administrative
skill. Owing
in the main to the
discretion of Great
Britain, war was
averted with that
power (§ <a href='#s376'>376</a>), and
Polk could point to a
very valuable addition
of territory in
the extreme Northwest,
into which population
was already
pouring. Tyler had
forestalled him with
regard to annexing Texas; but Polk could at least see to it that
Texas reached the Rio Grande, and that the United States thus
recovered territory which some persons believed to have been
imprudently abandoned by Monroe in his negotiations with
Spain (§ <a href='#s324'>324</a>). Yet to extend the bounds of Texas and, what
was more important, to acquire Upper California, would necessitate
a war with Mexico, and for this Polk and his well-chosen
Cabinet were prepared. They wanted only a short war, however,
and trusted to diplomacy and money to secure them the
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
territory that would give the United States a clear sweep to
the Pacific. Hence much of Polk’s warlike attitude was
hollow. His main purpose was to obtain money from Congress
with which to buy territory, and by diplomatic means to induce
Mexico to sell. He actually restored to his native land the
exiled Mexican general, Santa Anna, hoping that the latter
would, in gratitude, make a speedy peace. But the sly adventurer
induced his countrymen to fight the harder; and although
California and New Mexico were taken by the Americans without
a real struggle, peace with Mexico, and her acquiescence in
the results of the war, could be obtained only after long and
costly campaigns. Moreover, these campaigns entailed a political
result discouraging to Polk and the Democrats.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s379'></a><span class='bold'>379. Ambitions of Scott and Taylor.</span>—The leading soldier in
the United States was General Winfield Scott, the hero of
Lundy’s Lane (§ <a href='#s309'>309</a>). Military success in a republic generally
brings civil honors; and Scott was a Whig, with his
eyes already on the Presidency. A Democratic administration
could not bring itself to give Scott a chance to distinguish
himself, and for some time he was detained at Washington;
but his subordinate, General Zachary Taylor,<a id='r173'/><a href='#f173' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[173]</span></sup></a> who was at
first given command (§ <a href='#s377'>377</a>), was also Whig in his sympathies.
Such being the case, various expedients were suggested; it was
even intended to give Senator Benton supreme command, he
being a good Democrat and a colonel of the War of 1812. But
all schemes failed. Scott was finally sent to the front, and
Taylor (§ <a href='#s389'>389</a>) captured the Whig nomination for the Presidency
(1848). Such are some of the intrigues that the historian
finds behind the Mexican War. It is little wonder that
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
the Whigs—including old statesmen like Webster, and new
statesmen like Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, who was serving
his only term as congressman—should have denounced the
contest as wrong in itself and as prosecuted in the interests of
the slaveholders and land grabbers of the country. It is little
wonder, too, as we have seen, that the Mexican War does not
live in popular imagination as a heroic struggle (§ <a href='#s377'>377</a>).</p>

<h3 id='s380a'>THE CONDUCT AND RESULTS OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Zachary Taylor.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s380'></a><span class='bold'>380. Taylor’s Victories.</span>—Whatever we may think of the
causes of the Mexican War and of the conduct of the American
authorities, there can
be but one opinion as
to the valor with which
officers and troops
conducted themselves
after hostilities had
begun. Taylor received
notice from the Mexican
general, Arista, on
April 24, 1846, that
his occupation of the
northern branch of the
Rio Grande meant
war. On the same
day the first American
blood was shed. It
was avenged shortly;
for, on May 8, Taylor
met about six thousand
Mexicans at Palo
Alto, and defeated
them severely with
his own small force of
about two thousand. The next day he won another complete
victory at Resaca de la Palma, and drove the enemy across the
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
Rio Grande. The news of these victories aroused the country
and made Taylor a popular hero. He was already much loved
by his soldiers, who gave him the nickname of “Rough and
Ready,” because of his carelessness of dress and other details
and his thorough capability as a commander.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s381'></a><span class='bold'>381. Taylor’s Advance toward Mexico.</span>—War was formally
declared by the United States on May 13, Congress authorizing
the President to call out fifty thousand volunteers and voting
ten million dollars for expenses. On May 18, Taylor occupied
Matamoras, halting there until September. He then advanced
upon Monterey, other officers, military and naval, having meanwhile
been occupying New Mexico and Upper California. Monterey
fell, after a short siege, on September 24. But Mexico
would not yield, although Colonel Doniphan, after a long, hard
march, had taken Chihuahua and gained control of the important
surrounding region, and although victory had crowned
every effort of the Americans.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s382'></a><span class='bold'>382. Capture of Vera Cruz.</span>—As a speedy peace was much
desired by the administration, it now seemed necessary to
send General Scott<a id='r174'/><a href='#f174' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[174]</span></sup></a> to the front. It was determined that his
forces should sail early in the spring to Vera Cruz, and from
that place begin a march to the City of Mexico. He landed
at Vera Cruz on March 9, 1847, and after a bombardment took
the town twenty days later.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s383'></a><span class='bold'>383. Battle of Buena Vista.</span>—Meanwhile Santa Anna, in full
command once more, hearing in January that Scott had taken
ten thousand troops from Taylor, and believing that Vera Cruz
could hold out for some time, determined to make a swift
march northward and crush Taylor. It was a daring and
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
probably a good plan, but it failed. Taylor, then some distance
from Monterey, was not a whit daunted when, on February
20, he discovered about twelve thousand Mexicans in front
of his own five thousand troops. He retired and took up a
good position near Buena Vista, refusing Santa Anna’s demand
for surrender three days later, and inflicting a severe defeat
upon his enemy before the day closed (February 23, 1847).
The American loss was about eight hundred, the Mexican over
twice as many. The battle settled the fate of the territory that
America craved, and, moreover, determined who should be the
next President of the United States. Curiously enough, the
future President of the Confederate States, who was Taylor’s
own son-in-law, also won great distinction at Buena Vista.
Jefferson Davis fought with conspicuous bravery, showed
much tactical ingenuity, and was severely wounded in this
remarkable battle.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s384'></a><span class='bold'>384. Scott’s Great March.</span>—If Taylor’s career had been brilliant,
Scott’s was now to be more so. Unfortunately for the
latter’s Presidential aspirations, however, Taylor had already
caught the attention of the public. Besides, Scott, who was
strict with regard to discipline and fond of display,—qualities
that earned him the nickname of “Fuss and Feathers,”—was
not the man to secure popularity. Before his brilliant campaign
was over, he had several unpleasant difficulties with
subordinate officers. But, as a general, he showed himself to
be fully Taylor’s equal, perhaps his superior. Leaving Vera
Cruz, he forced, on April 18, the mountain pass of Cerro Gordo,
which had been fortified. It was defended by fifteen thousand
Mexicans under Santa Anna, whose courage had not been lessened
by his defeat at Buena Vista. Here again the Mexican
losses far exceeded the American. Three thousand prisoners
were captured, along with a great store of arms and artillery,
and three towns were taken. At one of these, Puebla, the army
halted for a rest of two months. At the beginning of August
the march on the capital was renewed, about eleven thousand
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
men moving forward. By August 18, they were within ten
miles of the city, where the enemy made a determined stand.
The next day and the day after saw three battles,—Contreras,
San Antonio, and Churubusco,—all fought with splendid
courage and great success against much larger forces of Mexicans,
who fought quite as desperately, but with less skill.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s385'></a><span class='bold'>385. The Capture of Mexico.</span>—The Mexicans being dispersed,
Scott might have entered the capital, but Polk wished to
render negotiations easy, and an armistice was granted in order
that terms of peace might be discussed. The American envoy,
N. P. Trist, was instructed to ask for New Mexico, the Californias,
and the region between the Nueces and the Rio Grande;
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
although he was authorized to drop the demand for Lower
California if necessary, and also to offer money for the other
territory. The Mexican commissioners would not agree to
these proposals, and in their turn offered less than Polk desired.
So the armistice was terminated. Then, on September 8, Scott
won the brilliant victory of Molino del Rey (“Mill of the
King”). Five days later, the heights of Chapultepec, as well
as two of the city’s gates, were stormed with great gallantry.
On the next day (September 14, 1847) a triumphal entry was
made into the Mexican capital, in the defense of which so
many gallant men had perished.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s386'></a><span class='bold'>386. The Best Feature of the War.</span>—The best feature of the
Mexican War was not the splendid territorial booty obtained,
nor the remarkable leadership displayed by Scott, Taylor, and
their subordinates, but the superior morale of the American
troops. As these were in the main volunteers, the conduct of
the war was all the more a credit to the nation, especially to
the Southern and Southwestern states, where the struggle had
been popular. These brave volunteers wiped out whatever
disgrace attached to the country from the shameful lack of
efficiency shown by the troops of 1812. The war was also
important for the training it furnished young officers who were
destined to play important parts in the Civil War. “Stonewall”
Jackson, McClellan, Grant, Lee, and other generals here
first showed the stuff that was in them.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s387'></a><span class='bold'>387. Results of the War.</span>—The unequal contest was settled
by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848). Mexico
had to agree to relinquish all her territory north of the Rio
Grande and Gila rivers. In compensation for Upper California
and New Mexico, the United States allowed her the sum of
fifteen million dollars, and undertook to pay some of its
own citizens who had claims against Mexico. The territory
thus acquired soon threw the country into great political confusion;
for certain Northern politicians were determined to
prevent, if possible, any extension of slavery in the domain
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
obtained by purchase, even though it lay south of 36° 30′
(§ <a href='#s329'>329</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s388'></a><span class='bold'>388. The Wilmot Proviso.</span>—As early as 1846, Representative
David A. Wilmot of Pennsylvania had proposed an amendment
to a bill pending, stipulating that no money should be
appropriated to purchase territory unless slavery were prohibited
therein; and though this amendment, known as the
Wilmot Proviso, had failed, the principle involved in it was
made the chief feature of the campaign of 1848.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s389'></a><span class='bold'>389. Election of 1848.</span>—In this struggle five parties were
engaged. Certain disaffected Democrats of New York, known
as Barn-burners,<a id='r175'/><a href='#f175' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[175]</span></sup></a> a party known as the Free Soilers, and the
old Liberty Party of the abolitionists,—all being opposed to
the extension of slavery,—finally nominated Van Buren. The
Democrats nominated Lewis Cass of Michigan, who advocated
what was afterward famous as Popular or Squatter Sovereignty,—that
is, the right of the people of each territory to
choose whether they would have slavery or not. The Whigs
nominated General Zachary Taylor of Louisiana, and placed on
the ticket with him Millard Fillmore of New York. Their
principles were not pronounced; but Taylor was a Southerner
and carried a large part of his section with him, while Van
Buren’s vote lost New York to the Democrats. Thus Taylor
and Fillmore were elected; but the South soon regretted the
fact, for the new President showed himself friendly to the
anti-slavery men by urging the admission of California as a
free state.</p>

<h3 id='s390a'><span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>THE QUESTION OF CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s390'></a><span class='bold'>390. General Conditions.</span>—The period of controversy upon
which we are about to enter, was caused by the opposing interests
and feelings of the North and South on the subject of
slavery. In the early history of the country, the balance of
power had been kept even by the alternate admission of free
and slave states. But the admission of Texas, and still more,
the results of the Mexican War, enlivened the hopes of the
South, while the Wilmot Proviso (§ <a href='#s388'>388</a>) showed that the North
was fully aware of the great interests involved in the annexation
of any new territory capable of supporting slavery.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s391'></a><span class='bold'>391. Claims of the South.</span>—The people of the South, especially
those of South Carolina and Mississippi, which had perhaps
become the most influential states in political matters, asserted
that the Fugitive Slave Law, provided for by the Constitution
and enacted into a statute by Congress in 1793, had not been
fairly carried out by the people of the North. Southerners also
charged the North with a growing tendency to misrepresent,
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
interfere with, and overthrow the institution of slavery, which
had been so carefully protected by the Constitution. They
saw that the North was growing much more rapidly than the
South, and that the time was not far away when the South might
be outvoted in Congress, with the result that, by a change of the
Constitution, slavery would perhaps be swept entirely away.
The circulation of anti-slavery newspapers, especially William
Lloyd Garrison’s <span class='it'>Liberator</span>, continued to give great offense to
the South, and caused laws to be passed by the Southern states
prohibiting the distribution of such journals. The feelings
thus aroused were further excited by repeated efforts to secure
the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s392'></a><span class='bold'>392. Claims of the North.</span>—In the North, on the other hand,
the feeling was constantly growing that slavery was a moral
wrong and a national disgrace. While the people generally
disavowed the right to interfere with the institution where
it already existed, they were determined to resist legislation
which would introduce it into any of the new territories. They
also claimed the right to the free expression of their opinion
and to the free publication of their views. It was evident that
only a definite occasion was needed to bring the sections to a
rupture which might precipitate a civil war. This occasion
soon came.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s393'></a><span class='bold'>393. California opens a New Question.</span>—In spite of the growing
estrangement of the sections, even the admission of Texas
furnished no definite ground for a positive clash. But the
acquisition of California introduced a new element into the
political situation. Part of the territory was south of the Missouri
Compromise line of 36° 30′, and part was north of it. The
inhabitants demanded admission to the Union as a state, and
the question at once arose whether California should be admitted
as a free or a slave state. The Californians asked to be
admitted as a free and undivided state. Their demands were
all the more weighty because of the newly acquired importance
of California in the eyes of the world.
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s394'></a><span class='bold'>394. California and the Discovery of Gold.</span>—California was a
beautiful region which offered many advantages besides that of
rounding out American territory on the Pacific. Its climate
was delightful; its soil fertile and capable of varied productions;
its forests were valuable. But a greater source of
wealth was soon discovered. In January, 1848, an American
mechanic named Marshall, in the employ of a Swiss named
Sutter, found gold in a mill-race near the Sacramento River.
The secret was not
kept, and soon every
industry in the
region was abandoned
and thousands
of men were
washing sand and
digging gold out of
the cliffs. The news
reached Washington
late in 1848, and the
next year saw a rush
for California, the
like of which had
never been known
before. Some adventurers made the long journey overland in
caravans formed of vehicles of every sort. Others tried the
dangerous voyage around Cape Horn. Others went by ship to
Panama, crossed the Isthmus, and took their chances of getting
a vessel on the Pacific side. Arrived in California, these
“Forty-niners,” as they have since been called, plunged into
the wild, exciting life described so well by Bret Harte. Soon
a population large enough to demand statehood was assembled,
and California began to play its great part in national affairs.<a id='r176'/><a href='#f176' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[176]</span></sup></a>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s395'></a><span class='bold'>395. Doctrines of Clay, Webster, and Calhoun.</span>—There was
naturally much excitement over the demand of the Californians,
and declarations of a purpose to secede were often heard
in Southern conventions. It was for the purpose of bringing
the North and the South nearer together, and preventing such
a catastrophe, that Henry
Clay, the author of the
Second Missouri Compromise,
now came forward
with the famous Compromise
of 1850. Before introducing
it, he had an interview with
Daniel Webster and secured
the promise of the latter’s
support. The debate on the
subject was one of the most
memorable in the history of
Congress. Clay, in one of
the greatest of his speeches,
described the dangers of the
situation and pointed out
that national disaster could
be averted only by a reasonable
yielding on both sides. Calhoun, nearing his grave,
and too feeble even to read his speech, was brought into
the Senate in a chair to hear his speech read by a colleague.
Reiterating his doctrine of the constitutional right of secession,
he maintained that a continuance of the present conditions was
impossible. But the greatest interest was concentrated upon
Webster. He was universally regarded as the foremost statesman
in the North. Though he had often deplored the existence
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
of slavery, and always opposed its extension, his views on
the matter of the Compromise now presented were not generally
known, and the declaration of his position was awaited
with intense anxiety. His speech on Clay’s measure, since commonly
referred to as the “Seventh of March Speech,” cast the
great weight of his powerful influence in favor of the Compromise.
His act was much criticised in the North, and he
was freely accused of seeking favor with the Southerners in
order to secure their help in the approaching Presidential election,
when he expected
to be a candidate. But
Webster had always
been a stanch advocate
of the Union, and
there was nothing in
his present course that
was inconsistent with
the positions he had
uniformly held. The
feeling against him,
however, became, in
many quarters of the
North, intensely bitter.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s396'></a><span class='bold'>396. Presidential
Policy changed by
Death of Taylor.</span>—Before
the final passage
of the Compromise
measures, President
Taylor died, July 9, 1850, and was succeeded by the Vice President,
Millard Fillmore. Taylor, although a Southerner, had been
very largely influenced by William H. Seward,<a id='r177'/><a href='#f177' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[177]</span></sup></a> a senator from
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
New York, who had led with great ability the opposition to
the Compromise. Taylor did not have a strong Cabinet, and
was untrained as a
statesman, but he
showed, in his short
administration, great
common sense and
firmness, and, had he
lived, might have prevailed
on Congress to
adopt a policy toward
California less tortuous
than that involved
in Clay’s Compromise.
Fillmore,<a id='r178'/><a href='#f178' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[178]</span></sup></a> who succeeded
to the Presidency,
although a good
man, was not a strong
one, and had not been
on friendly terms with
his fellow New Yorker,
Seward. In making
up his Cabinet, he
made Webster Secretary of State in place of Clayton, of Delaware,
and leaned upon the former for advice. The policy of
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
the administration was thus so completely changed that the
weight of its influence was at once thrown in favor of the
adoption and rigid enforcement of the Compromise legislation.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s397'></a><span class='bold'>397. The Compromise of 1850.</span>—The resolutions introduced
by Clay were much amended in the course of their consideration,
but in final form, as adopted in September, 1850, they
covered the following provisions:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. California was to be admitted as a free state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. New Mexico and Utah were to be organized as territories
without any restriction or condition in regard to slavery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The slave trade was to be abolished within the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. A Fugitive Slave Law, stringent enough to satisfy the
South, was to be passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. Texas was to receive the price she demanded for the land
ceded to New Mexico (§ <a href='#fn176'>394, note</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s398'></a><span class='bold'>398. New Fugitive Slave Law.</span>—That part of the Compromise
which provided for a Fugitive Slave Law was so stringent in
its provisions that it defeated its own end, by arousing so vigorous
an opposition in the North that it could not be enforced.
It had been made retroactive, in order that slaves who had
taken refuge in the North before the passage of the act might
be seized by United States marshals, and, without trial by
jury, forcibly taken to their old masters. This feature of the
law had an instantaneous effect on public opinion. It soon
came to be seen that the people would not permit men and
women who, as they said, had become free by living in a free
state, to be taken back into slavery. The law was frustrated
in many ways, the framers having overlooked one special weakness
in it. Though fugitives were not to be entitled to trial
by jury, the right of such a trial was not taken from the rescuers.
Many a fugitive was seized from the United States
marshals, and the rescuers, when tried, were acquitted by jury.<a id='r179'/><a href='#f179' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[179]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
New laws, known as Personal Safety Acts, designed to protect
fugitives and frustrate the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law,
were passed by the New England states and by New York,
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa.
These were specially referred to as a cause of complaint in the
South Carolina Act of Secession. For these various reasons,
the number of slaves actually returned was very small, and
both sections were dissatisfied with the result.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s399'></a><span class='bold'>399. “The Underground Railroad.”</span>—There was also organized
a system to assist fugitives to escape to Canada, where
they could not be arrested. Stations were established, generally
at private houses, where runaway slaves could be concealed in
the daytime and helped forward to the next station in the
night. The founder of this system was Levi Coffin, a Quaker
living near Philadelphia, who for several years helped into
freedom as many as one hundred slaves a year. This system,
known as the “Underground Railroad,” gradually extended
from the East as far west as the Missouri river. Thus, while
the Fugitive Slave Law greatly inflamed the North, the ways in
which it was frustrated greatly inflamed the South.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s400'></a><span class='bold'>400. New Leaders.</span>—Soon after the passage of this obnoxious
law, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster died. They were succeeded
in influence by younger men, of more strenuous beliefs and
methods. Of these William H. Seward of New York, Charles
Sumner of Massachusetts, and Salmon P. Chase of Ohio were
prominent representatives of the anti-slavery element, while
Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi,
William L. Yancey of Alabama, and Alexander H. Stephens
of Georgia were the most influential leaders on the other side.
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span></p>

<h3 id='s401a'>INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s401'></a><span class='bold'>401. The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty.</span>—Although the Compromise
of 1850 overshadows every other event of the period
covered by this chapter, it should not absorb the student’s
entire attention. Early in General Taylor’s administration,
certain international affairs of importance became pressing.
In 1826, the matter of a ship canal across Nicaragua or
Panama had been advocated by Henry Clay. “The benefits
of such a canal,” Clay wrote, “ought not to be exclusively
appropriated to any one nation, but should be extended to
all parts of the globe.” In the course of the following twenty
years, Jackson and Polk often reverted to the subject in the
same general spirit. When John M. Clayton of Delaware
entered upon his duties as Taylor’s Secretary of State, he
found that the question demanded immediate consideration,
for the reason that two capitalists, one American and one
British, were contemplating the construction of such a canal
across Nicaragua. The result was that on April 19, 1850,
what is known as the “Clayton-Bulwer Treaty” was signed in
Washington by Secretary Clayton and Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer,
the British Minister. The treaty provided that the two
powers should guarantee the neutrality and security of the
canal when completed, and they invited all friendly states to
enter into similar stipulations with them, “for the benefit of
mankind, on equal terms to all.” This treaty was afterward
to be the subject of not a little embarrassment (§ <a href='#s680'>680</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s402'></a><span class='bold'>402. Railways and Steamships.</span>—The passage of the Compromise
of 1850 seemed to promise peace with regard to slavery;
but the aid given by the South to attempts to conquer Cuba,
especially those of Narciso Lopez,<a id='r180'/><a href='#f180' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[180]</span></sup></a> proved to thoughtful minds
that sectional strife had been allayed, not completely suppressed.
Yet even then American industry and enterprise were forging
links of union against which sectional strife could not long
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
prevail. Before 1852, over ten thousand miles of railway track
had been laid in the United States, mainly in New England,
the Middle states, and the Northwest. The New York and
Erie road became a rival of the famous Erie Canal, and its
completion in the spring of 1851 was the occasion of a Railway
Jubilee, which was attended by Fillmore and his Cabinet.
Later in the year, a similar celebration was held in Boston.
On the ocean, also, speedier transportation was obtained.
The British Cunard Line and the American Collins Line
ran races for Europe, and travel was considerably stimulated.
On the inland waters navigation increased rapidly; but, owing
to a lack of proper inspection, many steamers took fire and
great loss of life ensued. The spread of the telegraph over the
country also brought distant points into contact in a way that
would have been deemed incredible a generation before.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s403'></a><span class='bold'>403. Kossuth’s Visit.</span>—The great growth in population, the acquisition
of vast territories, the surprising industrial and commercial
development, were not only uniting the people of
America, but were stimulating their emotional nature. The
quiet, staid country of two generations before no longer existed.
Popular furores became possible and a love of the spectacular
was developed. Barnum, the showman, laid the foundations
of his fortune. Newspapers rivaled one another in securing
news quickly. International yacht races were begun. Distinguished
men went on lecture tours through the country.
Great authors and actors came from abroad to receive American
hospitality and applause. There were women’s rights conventions
and agitations in behalf of temperance.<a id='r181'/><a href='#f181' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[181]</span></sup></a> But all these
elements of excitement were thrown into the shade by the
visit of Louis Kossuth, the great Hungarian orator who had
vainly attempted to secure the independence of his native land
and was now an exile. Invited by Congress, Kossuth late in
1851 reached the United States, on the man-of-war <span class='it'>Mississippi</span>.
He was received with an enthusiasm unequaled in our history,
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
save on the occasion of Lafayette’s visit. Receptions
were given him in all the chief cities, and he astonished his
hearers by the ease and power with which he spoke English.
But he made the mistake of trying to persuade the people that
the policy of non-interference in European affairs, established
by Washington, was an erroneous one. A few politicians, for
party purposes, seconded his proposal that the United States
should intervene in behalf of Hungary. But the nation at
large held aloof from him; the novelty of his visit wore off;
and the great orator returned to Europe a disappointed man.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s404'></a><span class='bold'>404. The Campaign of 1852.</span>—The next excitement was
caused by the Presidential campaign. The Democratic convention
held at Baltimore,—the most convenient convention
city in those days,—after much balloting, set aside the chief
candidates, Cass of Michigan, Douglas of Illinois, Buchanan
of Pennsylvania, and Marcy of New York, and chose General
Franklin Pierce<a id='r182'/><a href='#f182' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[182]</span></sup></a> of New Hampshire, a man who hitherto had
attracted little attention. He had served in the Mexican War,
and was upright in character; but he possessed a mind little
capable of guiding the country in the great crisis that was approaching.
His friendship with Jefferson Davis and other
Southern leaders foretold his alliance with the advocates
of slavery; but as people thought the slavery question settled
by the Compromise of 1850, this did not interfere with his
chances at the polls. William R. King of Alabama was nominated
for Vice President, and the Democrats went into the campaign
with great hopes of success. On the other hand, the
Whigs were divided and depressed. After a hard struggle,
Fillmore—who had made many enemies by signing the Fugitive
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
Slave Law—and Daniel Webster had to yield the nomination
to General Winfield Scott, who was far from popular.
Shortly afterward,
the deaths of Clay
and Webster (who
was bitterly disappointed
and hostile
to Scott) robbed
the party of its
real leaders; important
Southern
Whigs held aloof
from Scott; the
Free Soil party put
up candidates of
its own; and the
hero of the march
to Mexico was
badly beaten by a
younger and inferior
man. Pierce
had two hundred
and fifty-four electoral
votes to Scott’s forty-two. The ambiguous attitude of the
Whigs toward the slavery question had hopelessly split the
party asunder. Scott’s personal unpopularity also partly accounts
for the overwhelming character of the defeat suffered
by the Whigs; and doubtless there was a general desire to
give the Compromise a fair chance under the Democrats, who
heartily favored it.</p>

Meanwhile, New Mexico attracted little attention, except so far as part
of her territory was claimed by Texas. This claim, in the support of which
much sectional spirit was shown, but in which President Taylor displayed
great firmness and devotion to the Union, was finally compromised. In
December, 1853, by what is known as the Gadsden Purchase, about 45,000
square miles were acquired from Mexico, and the southern boundary of the
United States was rounded off.</p>

One of the most famous cases of resistance to the law occurred in Boston
in May, 1854. A negro named Anthony Burns was arrested as a fugitive
slave. Before his final examination by the United States Commissioner took
place, a mass meeting to protest against his surrender to the person claiming
him as a slave was held in Faneuil Hall. A premature attempt was made to
rescue him and several persons were wounded. Finally, when the Commissioner
ordered his surrender, many houses were draped in black and a riot
was with difficulty averted. Burns eventually became a Baptist clergyman
in Canada.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s405'></a><span class='bold'>405. Character of Pierce’s Administration.</span>—The passage of the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill and the war in Kansas are the most
important features of
Pierce’s administration
(§§ <a href='#s411'>411</a>-<a href='#s414'>414</a>).
The new President,
being amiable and
weak, yielded to the
counsels of Jefferson
Davis and Caleb
Cushing<a id='r183'/><a href='#f183' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[183]</span></sup></a> of his Cabinet,
and took a strong
pro-slavery position,
with the result that
he speedily lost his
popularity, save in
the South. At first,
however, he pleased
most of his fellow-citizens,
especially on
such occasions as his
visit to the World’s Fair at New York in 1853, where he made
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
a glowing speech. But although Pierce himself is almost forgotten,
his administration is of great importance to the student,
since its leading events and measures were most instrumental
in bringing on the Civil War.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s406'></a><span class='bold'>406. The Know-Nothings.</span>—Pierce’s administration was distinguished
by the rise of a new, short-lived party, which for
a time caused apprehension in the older organizations, and
had much to do with the overthrow of the Whigs. This was
the American party, which became prominent in 1852. Its
members were popularly known as “Know-Nothings,” because,
being bound by oath to reveal nothing concerning their organization,
they always answered inquiries in this negative fashion.
It had “lodges,” which sent delegates to secret nominating
conventions, and its strength could not be gauged before an
election. Its chief object was to prevent foreigners from being
too easily and speedily naturalized and to elect native-born
Americans to office. Similar organizations had existed before
and have been developed since; but the American people have
never long tolerated illiberal and secret parties. The Know-Nothings
carried some state elections and put candidates in
the field for the campaign of 1856, but they soon after disappeared
from the political stage. The party furnished a refuge
to many Whigs, particularly from the South, for it was neutral
on the slavery question. Its growth was accelerated by
the bad influence on local politics, especially in New York
City, exerted by the crowds of ignorant foreigners who sought
our shores after the Revolution of 1848 and the great Irish
famine. Nothing could have been more disgraceful than the
corrupt municipal government of New York City about this
time, and many citizens feared that the rest of the country
would be contaminated.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s407'></a><span class='bold'>407. Attempts to Secure Cuba.</span>—Attempts to seize territory
to the south in the interests of slavery, continued during
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
Pierce’s administration. In 1853, a bold adventurer named
William Walker gathered rash followers and made an attack
on Lower California, which completely failed. The next
year, leading Southerners like General Quitman, an adopted
citizen of Mississippi and a distinguished soldier in the
Mexican War, tried to secure Cuba by forcing the United
States into a war with Spain on account of the confiscation of
an American steamer, <span class='it'>The Black Warrior</span>. This attempt was
merged in the intrigues that produced the Ostend Manifesto.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s408'></a><span class='bold'>408. The Ostend Manifesto.</span>—On the 16th of August, 1854,
William L. Marcy, Pierce’s Secretary of State, wrote to Pierre
Soulé, the American minister at Madrid, that “much advantage
might accrue from an interchange of views between himself,
Buchanan, and Mason” (the Ministers to Great Britain and
France) “in regard to the acquisition of Cuba.” Accordingly,
these three Ministers met at Ostend, Belgium, and after a conference
of a few days, promulgated the paper known as the
“Ostend Manifesto” (October 18, 1854). They declared, first,
that Cuba should belong to the United States; second, that
the government might well offer for the island the sum of one
hundred and twenty million dollars; and third, that if Spain
would not accept this sum, the matter of conquest ought to be
considered. The manifesto was generally well received in the
South, but in the North it was characterized as “the manifesto
of brigands.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s409'></a><span class='bold'>409. Filibustering.</span>—Soon Central America attracted the filibusters,
as these adventurous invaders of peaceable states were
called. In 1854 a little place named Greytown, on the Mosquito
coast, was bombarded by an American ship for no very
good reason. The next year, Walker interfered in a revolution
in Nicaragua, and for a while got control of the state by making
a creature of his, named Rivas, president. The new government
was recognized by Pierce, but was shortly after overthrown.<a id='r184'/><a href='#f184' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[184]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s410'></a><span class='bold'>410. Perry’s Expedition.</span>—Although the disgraceful actions
of the filibusters and the war in Kansas seem to mark Pierce’s
administration as a thoroughly discreditable one, it was not
without bright features. In 1854 a commercial treaty with
Japan was secured as the result of a naval expedition which
had been sent out in 1852 under Commodore Matthew C. Perry.
This treaty, which was promulgated in 1855, is memorable as
opening a place for Japan among the great nations of the world.</p>

<h3 id='s411a'>KANSAS-NEBRASKA LEGISLATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s411'></a><span class='bold'>411. Disappointment of the South: Kansas-Nebraska Bill.</span>—The
South was not only unable to secure Cuba and other slave
territory, but could not help seeing that the advantage it
had anticipated from the Fugitive Slave Law could never be
realized. Some new measure was necessary, or all the benefits
of the Compromise would go to the North. Such a measure
presented itself in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, put forward by
Senator Douglas of Illinois. This bill was framed on the
untenable theory that the Missouri Compromise had been overthrown
by the Compromise of 1850, and that the provision
that slavery could not exist north of 36° 30′ was no longer
binding. In accordance with this theory, the author of the
bill proposed that the Missouri Compromise should be declared
“inoperative and void as being inconsistent with the principle
of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states and
territories.” It was also proposed that all the lands of the
Louisiana Purchase north of 36° 30′ should be organized as
territories and in due time should be admitted as states, either
free or slave, as the voters of each territory might determine.
The great question was thus to be settled, not by United States
law, but by what came to be called “Popular Sovereignty.”
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s412'></a><span class='bold'>412. Indignation of the North.</span>—The bill aroused the greatest
political agitation the country had ever known, for the opponents
of the measure took the ground that it turned over to
possible slavery a vast tract that had forever been dedicated to
freedom. They said it was an outrageous violation of contract
to take away half of the Missouri Compromise, when the
advocates of slavery had enjoyed the advantage of the other
half, as they had in the admission of Missouri as a slave state
above the line of 36° 30′. The bill was opposed with the utmost
vigor by Seward, Sumner, and other anti-slavery leaders, but it
was passed and became a law, May 30, 1854.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s413'></a><span class='bold'>413. Occupation of Kansas.</span>—Now began a race for the settlement
of the new territory, as the only possible way in
which freedom could be protected. As Kansas bordered on
Missouri, it was evident that here was to be the battle ground.
Slave owners from Missouri rushed in to take possession of the
soil, but the people of the North were not slow to see the
danger. An Emigrant Aid Society was quickly organized in
Massachusetts, by Eli Thayer, to encourage and fit out emigrants
to the new territory. Though the slaveholders were
first in the field, people from the North soon followed in ever
increasing numbers. Party spirit ran so high that collisions
were inevitable. There was universal disorder and some
bloodshed. Guerrilla bands of both parties wandered over the
country and fought wherever they met. On the 21st of May,
1856, the town of Lawrence, the headquarters of the anti-slavery
party, was attacked by marauders from Missouri, popularly
known as “Border Ruffians,” and several of the most
important buildings were sacked and burned. Three days
later, a deliberately planned massacre of slave owners was
perpetrated in retaliation, at Pottawatomie, by an anti-slavery
band led by John Brown.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s414'></a><span class='bold'>414. Advantages of the North in the Contest.</span>—The anti-slavery
cause was helped by the unusual severity of the winter
of 1855–1856, which made it evident that slavery could not
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
prosper in Kansas. The largest slaveholder in the territory
was obliged, with his own hands, to cut and haul wood to keep
his negroes warm, and
even then one of them
froze to death in his
bed. Meanwhile, the
Free State men increased
rapidly in
numbers.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s415'></a><span class='bold'>415. Assault upon
Sumner.</span>—While the
Kansas question was
raising to a white
heat all sections of
the country, an event
occurred to intensify
the excitement. In
the course of the long
debate in Congress on
the Kansas troubles,
Charles Sumner,<a id='r185'/><a href='#f185' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[185]</span></sup></a> on
the 19th and 20th of
May, 1856, delivered
his celebrated speech,
“The Crime against
Kansas.” It was the
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
most terrible philippic ever uttered in the Senate, and it exasperated
the men of the South beyond measure. Particularly severe
was Sumner’s attack on Senator Butler, of South Carolina.
Two days after the delivery of this speech, Sumner was writing
a letter at his desk, after the Senate had adjourned, when
he was approached by Preston S. Brooks, from South Carolina,
a nephew of Butler and a member of the House of Representatives.
Brooks struck Sumner repeated blows on the head with
a cane and felled him to the floor. The injuries Sumner received
affected his spine and were so serious that it was
more than three years before he could be restored to a fair
amount of vigor. While, in the South, a few persons deprecated
the assault, Brooks was welcomed by the masses as a
hero. In the North the attack was universally condemned,
and stirred the deepest indignation. An effort was made in
the House of Representatives to expel Brooks, but only one
Southerner voted for his expulsion, and the motion failed to
receive the necessary two-thirds majority. A severe vote of
censure, however, was passed by a large majority; whereupon
Brooks resigned his place, and appealed to his constituents for
indorsement and reëlection. In the election that followed,
only six votes were cast against him. The speech, the assault,
and the indorsement of Brooks inflamed every part of the
country.</p>

<h3 id='s416a'>THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s416'></a><span class='bold'>416. Origin of the Republican Party.</span>—It was during the
excitement that followed the assault on Sumner that politicians
prepared for the coming Presidential election of 1856. The
overwhelming defeat of the Whigs at the election in 1852
seemed at the time to give the Democrats a long lease of power.
In reality, they soon found themselves confronted by political
foes more determined than the Whigs. The old Whig party
had been shattered by differences on the question of slavery.
Evidently there was call for a new party on the great questions
now at issue, and the Republican party was the result.
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
At a political meeting held at Ripon, Wisconsin, in May, 1854,
it was resolved that another party should be formed and that
it should be called “Republican.” It is generally admitted
that the first formal adoption of the name, which was probably
due to a suggestion of Horace Greeley, and the publication of
an elaborate platform were the work of a convention held at
Jackson, Michigan, on the 6th of July following. The new
party designation was immediately adopted by state conventions
in Maine, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa.
So extremely vigorous was the organization of the Republicans,
that, in the fall of 1854, they elected enough members
to control the House of Representatives and chose as Speaker,
Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts. The first National
Convention of the party was held at Pittsburgh on February
22, 1856; but it was not until June 17, at Philadelphia, that
a platform was adopted and candidates for the Presidency and
Vice Presidency were chosen. The platform declared that
“the Constitution confers upon Congress sovereign power over
the Territories of the United States for their government, and
that in the exercise of this power, it is both the right and the
imperative duty of Congress to prohibit in the Territories those
twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” Upon the
stand thus taken, the Republicans soon secured political supremacy
in the North and West.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s417'></a><span class='bold'>417. The Campaign of 1856.</span>—The Republicans nominated
John C. Frémont<a id='r186'/><a href='#f186' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[186]</span></sup></a> of California, a famous explorer of the
West, for President, and William L. Dayton of New Jersey
for Vice President. The Democrats, shelving the now unpopular
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
Pierce, nominated James Buchanan,<a id='r187'/><a href='#f187' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[187]</span></sup></a>—a weak character,
far past the prime of life, but a man who had held high
positions and was likely to carry the important state of Pennsylvania.
John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky was chosen as
Buchanan’s running mate.
Buchanan won at the
polls, securing one hundred
and seventy-four
electoral votes to Frémont’s
one hundred and
fourteen. But the Republicans
had made a
better fight than any new
party had ever done before
and had carried most
of the Northern and some
of the Western states.
It was evident that the
country was being divided
sectionally in politics,—the
North and West being destined to become more and more
anti-slavery, or Republican, the South to be overwhelmingly
pro-slavery, or Democratic. Many persons, especially in the
South, argued that this state of things would warrant a dissolution
of the Union, since the North and West combined might
be strong enough to interfere with slavery in the states.</p>

Walker made another attempt in 1857, but was arrested at Greytown and

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s418'></a><span class='bold'>418. Dred Scott Decision.</span>—Two days after Buchanan’s inauguration,
the Supreme Court rendered a decision that had a
tremendous influence on public opinion with regard to the
question of slavery. A colored man, Dred Scott by name, was
held as a slave in Missouri, but having been taken by his
master into Illinois and Minnesota, he brought suit in a United
States court to establish his freedom. The question finally
reached the Supreme Court, where a decision was rendered
March 6, 1857. The court held:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. That negroes had not been regarded as citizens by the
framers of the Constitution, and that, therefore, they could
not bring suit in a United States court.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. That the Constitution recognizes the right of property in
slaves, and recognizes no difference between such property
and any other, and that therefore Congress could not limit
the right of property in slaves, even in the territories.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. That the Missouri Compromise, limiting the right of property
in slaves, was unconstitutional, and therefore null
and void; and that, therefore, slave owners could carry
their slaves into any part of the territories, and hold them
as such without regard to the line established by the
Missouri Compromise.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The opinion was rendered by Chief Justice Taney,<a id='r188'/><a href='#f188' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[188]</span></sup></a> and was
assented to by a majority of the court. Justices McLean and
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
Curtis, however, dissented, and Curtis presented an elaborate
dissenting opinion. The importance of the decision lay in the
fact that it was an authoritative
approval by the Supreme
Court of views
advanced by Calhoun, and
generally indorsed by the
South.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s419'></a><span class='bold'>419. The Dissenting
Opinion.</span>—The North, naturally,
accepted the views
of the dissenting opinion,
which held:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. That free negroes had
been citizens before
the adoption of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. That the Constitution
had not limited the
rights of such negroes as citizens.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. That as many as seven Acts had been passed by Congress
limiting slavery in the territories, and that these Acts had
been assented to by Presidents who had been in the Constitutional
Convention.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. That the constitutionality of these Acts had never been
questioned.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. That the validity of the Missouri Compromise was not
before the court, and that the dissenting Justices did
“not hold any opinion of this court, or any court, binding
when expressed on a question not legitimately before
it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s420'></a><span class='bold'>420. Influence of the Decision.</span>—The far-reaching effects of
this decision were at once apparent. The Republican party
had been organized on the fundamental avowal that it was the
duty of Congress to keep slavery out of the territories (§ <a href='#s416'>416</a>).
But if Congress had no constitutional right to interfere with
slavery in the territories, the Republican party could have no
right to exist. The decision also shattered Douglas’s doctrine
of Popular Sovereignty; for, if Congress had no right to exclude
slavery, it could not confer such a right upon the territorial
legislature. The South asked, “What are you going to
do about it?” The North virtually replied that it adopted the
view of Justice Curtis and rejected the decision as of no binding
force. Many persons in the North accepted a doctrine that
had some time before been promulgated by Mr. Seward,—that
there is a “higher law” of right and morality than that of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s421'></a><span class='bold'>421. Abolition Orators.</span>—Public feeling during these years
was much intensified in the North by the political speeches
delivered by accomplished orators in various parts of the country.
The most prominent of these speakers was Wendell
Phillips of Boston, who gave his life chiefly to anti-slavery
agitation and exerted a vast influence. His work was supplemented
effectively by the speeches of Theodore Parker, George
William Curtis, Theodore Tilton, Anna Dickinson, and others.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s422'></a><span class='bold'>422. Two Important Books.</span>—In the course of this agitation,
public opinion was greatly affected by the appearance of two
very important books on the subject of slavery. Mrs. Harriet
Beecher Stowe’s <span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span> appeared in 1852. Its
object was to represent the horrors of slavery, and it proved to
be one of the most influential novels ever published. Though
it was intended to represent slavery in the strongest possible
light, the picture was somewhat relieved for the people
of the South by the fact that the worst characters in the
book were “renegades” from the North. Over three hundred
thousand copies were sold within a year of its publication, and
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
in the course of five years it had powerfully inflamed the feelings
of all the Northern people. In 1857, appeared H. R.
Helper’s <span class='it'>Impending Crisis of the South</span>. It was written by a
representative of the “poor white” class of North Carolina,
whose purpose was to arraign
slavery from the
point of view of the Southern
free white laborer.
The author described
Southern society, and
showed how slavery had
reduced the poorer white
people to a condition of
abject misery. The book
did much to arouse the
fears of the Southern slave
owners.</p>

<h3 id='s423a'>KANSAS AND UTAH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s423'></a><span class='bold'>423. Buchanan’s Weakness.</span>—Meanwhile,
President
Buchanan had been
showing in many ways that
he did not realize the gravity
of the situation. He
was an old man and inclined
to rely on Democratic leaders of strong pro-slavery proclivities.
Thus, although himself a Northerner, he had little support from
his own section. His Cabinet contained four Southerners,
while the Secretary of State, General Cass, was a sympathizer
with the Southern attitude toward the slavery question.
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
Eventually this Cabinet was broken up and a stronger one
obtained (§ <a href='#s441'>441</a>), but not before many of the departments,
especially those of War and of the Treasury, were reduced to
a state of great disorganization. Indeed, so badly were the
finances of the nation managed, that treasury notes had to be
issued in order that national insolvency might be avoided.
Yet more than once President Buchanan proposed to Congress
that Cuba should be purchased, and recommended other
rash legislation, which, if carried out, would probably have led
to a war with Mexico and the states of Central America.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>James Buchanan.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s424'></a><span class='bold'>424. Affairs in Kansas.</span>—One of Buchanan’s most important
appointments was that of Robert J. Walker of Mississippi,
who had been Secretary
of the Treasury
under Polk, as governor
of Kansas.
Walker understood
that he was to cease
trying to force slavery
upon the Kansas
settlers, but was
rather to attempt to
make the territory a
state favorable to the
Democrats. On this
understanding he succeeded
in inducing
the friends of freedom
to vote for members
of the territorial legislature,
with the result
that they obtained a
clear majority in that
body. But the slavery advocates, at a convention held at
Lecompton, adopted a constitution favoring slavery, with a
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
proviso that the article relating to the institution was the only
one that should be submitted to the people for ratification.
Fearing some trick, the Free State people stayed away from
the polls, and the Lecompton constitution was easily carried
by a partisan vote. Walker then went to Washington in order
to protest against conduct which, it was believed, was connived
at by the administration. He found that Buchanan and his
advisers were hearty advocates of the Lecompton constitution,
whereupon he resigned his governorship.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s425'></a><span class='bold'>425. Failure of the Lecompton Scheme.</span>—Meanwhile, the Free
State legislature of Kansas had submitted the whole Lecompton
constitution to the people, and it had been rejected by over
eleven thousand majority. Yet Buchanan, in a special message
to Congress, urged the admission of Kansas as a state under
the obnoxious instrument. A long and fierce debate was the
result, Senator Douglas, to his credit, standing out against the
majority of his party. The pro-slavery Democrats were obstinate,
in spite of many warnings, and pushed matters to a vote.
The administration’s measure for making Kansas a slave state
passed the Senate, but failed in the House. Later a discreditable
bill attempting to bribe Kansas to come in under the pro-slavery
constitution passed Congress; but the Kansas people
refused by a large majority to enter the Union hampered by
slavery, even if they could thereby acquire a large grant of
public lands. The bill which offered Kansas this bribe was
popularly known as “Lecompton Junior.” After it was
rejected by the Kansans, affairs in the region became comparatively
quiet. The territory was not finally admitted as a
state until 1861.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s426'></a><span class='bold'>426. The Mormons.</span>—Buchanan was more successful in his
dealings with the Mormons of Utah. This religious sect was
founded in 1830 by their Prophet, Joseph Smith, and was
forced to move steadily westward from the State of New York.
They settled first in Ohio, then in Illinois, where in 1840 they
founded the town of Nauvoo. These Latter-Day Saints, as
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
they were called, soon had troubles, without great fault of
their own, with the authorities of Illinois, in the course of
which Smith was arrested. Shortly after he was shot by a
mob (June 21, 1844). Brigham Young was chosen leader of
the new church in the Prophet’s place, and the next year the
Mormons left Illinois. After many vicissitudes, a settlement
was made in Utah, and Salt Lake City was founded in 1848.
The next year, Young was elected governor of Deseret, as
the territory was first named. In 1850 Congress established
the Territory of Utah, and, in 1851, Young became its authorized
governor. In 1852 he proclaimed polygamy to be a tenet of
the Mormon church. This and other causes led to difficulties
with judges and other officers of the United States, who in
consequence left Utah.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s427'></a><span class='bold'>427. Buchanan’s Management of the Mormon Difficulty.</span>—Affairs
soon reached such a pass as to require the removal of
Brigham Young from his position as territorial governor, the
Mormon desperadoes, under the name of Danites, or “destroying
angels,” having inaugurated a small reign of terror. Buchanan
supported the newly appointed governor, Alfred Cumming,
with forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston, who was
much harassed, however, by the destruction of his supply
trains. Congress hesitated to give the President all the troops
needed, for fear he might use them in Kansas; but he managed
the affair well, notwithstanding, and with augmented forces
and judicious pardons secured comparative tranquillity in Utah
before the summer of 1858. But Congress still refused to give
so strange a sect the right either to form a state or to elect
their own officers.<a id='r190'/><a href='#f190' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[190]</span></sup></a></p>

of the country were more interested in a picturesque
political campaign than in the pacification of a far-off territory.
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
The term of Senator Douglas was to expire in
1859, and he appealed to public opinion in Illinois for reëlection.
The Republicans
put forward
Abraham Lincoln as
their representative
to oppose him. The
men were unlike in
almost every respect.
Douglas<a id='r191'/><a href='#f191' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[191]</span></sup></a> in early
life had come from
Vermont to Illinois,
where he had risen
to distinction as a
lawyer and a debater.
In public speech he
was keen, ingenious,
and powerful, and
his leadership of the
movement in behalf
of Popular Sovereignty
had given him
a national reputation.
Lincoln,<a id='r192'/><a href='#f192' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[192]</span></sup></a> on the other hand, had been born to the most
abject poverty in Kentucky, and in early life had moved with
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
his parents to Indiana, and then to Illinois. In his boyhood
he had lived in a log hut, and had picked up almost the whole
of his education by reading and study at odd moments. At
length he studied law, and, though never a learned lawyer, he
early showed remarkable power in discovering the turning
point of a case, and presenting it with such clearness and
force that he was very successful. By a careful study of a
few of the best writers, he made himself a master of accurate
and powerful English speech. He also became very skillful
as a judge of human nature and in the art of persuading an
audience. To these great qualities he added the still greater
one of an honesty and integrity of thought and character so
pronounced and transparent that he was generally respected
and loved. At the time of this senatorial contest, Lincoln was
forty-nine years of age; Douglas was forty-five.
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s429'></a><span class='bold'>429. The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.</span>—In the spring of 1858,
Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of public debates on the
great questions of the day. They arranged for seven meetings
in different parts of Illinois, and those meetings are memorable
for the thoroughness with which questions then agitating the
nation were discussed. Lincoln at the outset announced the
Republican doctrine that slavery was entitled to the protection
of Congress where it existed, but that it could and ought to be
prevented from going into the territories where it did not
already exist. Douglas, throughout the discussion, held that
the Dred Scott Decision was binding, and tried to reconcile
it with the notion of Popular Sovereignty. Lincoln very
shrewdly saw the impossibility of reconciling these two views,
and used his advantage with great skill and vigor.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>A Typical Pioneer’s Cabin.</span><br/> Built by Lincoln’s father when he moved to Illinois.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s430'></a><span class='bold'>430. The Freeport Doctrine.</span>—The turning point in the debates
was at Freeport, where Lincoln put to Douglas this question:
“Can the people of a United States territory, in any legal way,
against the will of any citizen of the United States, exclude
slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution?”
The Republican committee managing the campaign,
urged Lincoln not to ask Douglas the question. They said,
“If Douglas answers ‘yes,’ he will surely be elected, because
the people of Illinois believe in Squatter Sovereignty.” Lincoln’s
reply was in substance: “Very well, if he answers ‘no,’
he cannot be elected senator in Illinois. If he answers ‘yes,’
as from his Squatter Sovereignty doctrine he will be obliged to
do, he will offend the South in such a way that he cannot be
elected President in 1860. I am looking for the larger game.”
Lincoln insisted upon asking the question, and his prediction
proved true. Douglas answered “yes,” and tried to reconcile
Squatter Sovereignty with the Dred Scott Decision, in what
came to be known as the “Freeport Doctrine”; but Lincoln
pointed out with great power that such a reconciliation was
absolutely impossible. Though Douglas was reëlected to the
Senate, as the Republican committee predicted he would be if the
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
question were asked, the rift in the Democratic party soon made
it apparent that its Northern and Southern sections could not
unite on any one candidate for President. Lincoln had accomplished
his object, though he had lost the senatorship.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s431'></a><span class='bold'>431. Other Speeches of Lincoln and Douglas.</span>—In 1859, Douglas
spoke and wrote much, in order to define his position on the
relations of the Federal power and the power of the individual
states. In all his utterances he often referred to the
positions held by Lincoln, and, especially in the South, he
tried to recover what he had lost in the discussion of what
was known as the “Freeport Doctrine.” Lincoln delivered,
at Columbus and Cincinnati, speeches which pointed out
with merciless logic the impossibility of Douglas’s contention.
These speeches tersely reproduced the arguments he had
used in Illinois, and in print they had an enormous circulation.
Lincoln’s prominence, moreover, was greatly increased
by a masterly speech on February 27, 1860, at the Cooper
Institute, in New York City. Taking as his subject, “The
Crisis,” he analyzed the situation, and presented it with a
logical force and clearness which placed the speech in the
highest rank of argumentative orations. This speech, and
those he immediately afterward made in New England, caused
Lincoln to be better known throughout the East; he was already
very popular in the West.</p>

<h3 id='s432a'>JOHN BROWN AND PUBLIC OPINION.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>John Brown.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s432'></a><span class='bold'>432. John Brown’s Raid.</span>—In the later months of 1859 the
country in all its parts was greatly moved by a fanatical attempt
to induce the slaves of Virginia to revolt and insist upon
freedom. John Brown,<a id='r193'/><a href='#f193' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[193]</span></sup></a> who, as we have seen, played a conspicuous
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
part in the Kansas difficulties, held the views of the
abolitionists with all the stern severity of a seventeenth century
Puritan. He believed that slavery was the “sum of all
abominations,” and that he must devote himself to its overthrow.
In July, 1859, he rented two houses on the Maryland
side of the Potomac, about four miles from Harper’s Ferry.
Here arms were collected,
and on the 16th of October
Brown mustered eighteen
men, five of whom were
negroes, for his intended
attack. They cut the telegraph
wires, and seized
the watchman on the
bridge; then, crossing to
the Virginia side, Brown
and two followers broke
into the United States
armory, and, binding the
watchman, remained on
guard. Before midnight
he was master of Harper’s
Ferry. But the inevitable
result followed. The negroes
refused to revolt, and soon the raiders were surrounded
by an overwhelming force. They fought desperately, and did
not surrender until, of the nineteen, ten had been killed. Four
escaped and five were taken prisoners. Brown himself, after
receiving several wounds in the head and body, was cut down
and captured. Notwithstanding his wounds, he was brought
to trial eight days after his arrest and, after a fair examination,
was condemned to be hanged on the 2d of December. He died
in the unwavering belief that he had contributed to a great
cause. Almost the whole nation was thrown into an uproar.
Republicans generally disavowed and condemned the act, but
the people of the South had their fears multiplied.
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s433'></a><span class='bold'>433. Resolutions of Jefferson Davis.</span>—On February 2, 1860,
Jefferson Davis, who had already come to be recognized as the
ablest leader of the Southern Democrats, submitted to the
Senate a series of resolutions designed to formulate the Southern
party doctrine. The most significant and important of
these resolutions was the fourth, which declared that “neither
Congress, nor a Territorial Legislature, whether by direct legislation
or by legislation of an indirect and unfriendly character,
possesses power to annul or impair the constitutional right
of any citizen of the United States to take his slave property
into the common territories, and there hold and enjoy the same
while the territorial condition remains.” This resolution was
no doubt intended not only to formulate a doctrine for the
guidance of the South, but also to inflict a fatal stab upon
Douglas, for the Illinois Senator had taken the ground, in the
“Freeport Doctrine,” that notwithstanding the Dred Scott
Decision, the people of a territory could make slavery impossible
by what he called “unfriendly legislation.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s434'></a><span class='bold'>434. Movements of Public Opinion in the South.</span>—While these
discussions were going on in the North, public opinion was also
taking form in the South. In various conventions, notably
the one held at Nashville in 1850, much had been done to
foster disunion sentiments. Secession seemed on the point
of immediate accomplishment, and would very probably have
taken place, but for the opposition of some of the leading
Whigs of the South and the adoption of the Compromise of
1850. Although the crisis in that year was tided over, the
South did not cease to proclaim that if ever a President should
be elected by a sectional vote secession would inevitably follow.
Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, and some of the
other leading Whigs attempted to oppose the movement as impolitic
and unlikely to succeed, but they were swept away by
an irresistible tide of public opinion, led by the more strenuous
of the politicians. This movement increased in violence from
1850 to 1860. The fact that the reopening of the foreign slave
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
trade was boldly advocated in various trade conventions, shows
plainly how far the extreme pro-slavery men were willing to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s435'></a><span class='bold'>435. Democratic Nominating Conventions.</span>—The first outbreak
of the coming storm occurred in the Democratic National Convention
of 1860. This was held in Charleston, South Carolina,
and lasted from April 23 to April 30. The delegates of the
South were marshaled by William L. Yancey of Alabama;
those of the North by Senator George H. Pugh of Ohio. The
main contest was over the majority and minority reports of
the Committee on Platform. While the Southern delegates
demanded a declaration in accordance with Davis’s resolution
that neither Congress nor any territorial government had the
right to legislate in regard to slavery in any territory, the
delegates of the North planted themselves firmly on the “Freeport
Doctrine” of Popular Sovereignty. The storm raged with
the utmost fury, in the midst of which Yancey declared that
if the Popular Sovereignty doctrine were adopted, the Southern
delegation would withdraw from the Convention. The
followers of Douglas secured a majority, whereupon Yancey
and his followers made good their threat, and marched out.
This was the beginning of practical secession. Though the
remaining delegates were a majority, they were not two-thirds
of the Convention, and, therefore, no nomination under the rule
of Democratic conventions could be made. The seceding faction
adjourned to meet at Richmond, June 11, the others at
Baltimore, June 18. An attempt was made to unite them at
Baltimore, but both sides were firm, and the effort was fruitless.
The consequence was that the Democrats finally made three
nominations. John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, was the
candidate of the Southern wing; Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois,
of the Northern; and John Bell, of Tennessee, of the
Conservatives, who vainly hoped still to bring the factions
together. Thus the predictions of Lincoln were abundantly
fulfilled.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s436'></a><span class='bold'>436. The Republican Nominating Convention.</span>—The Republican
Convention met on the 16th of May, in Chicago. Seward
was the most prominent candidate, but the names of Chase<a id='r194'/><a href='#f194' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[194]</span></sup></a> of
Ohio, Cameron of Pennsylvania, Dayton of New Jersey, and
Bates of Missouri
were all presented by
the delegates of their
respective states. Lincoln’s
name showed
great strength, as he
was supported not only
by Illinois, but also by
many votes from Indiana,
Kentucky, Ohio,
and New England.
The platform adopted
was in strict accordance
with all Lincoln’s
private and public utterances.
It advocated
no interference with
slavery where it existed,
no extension of
slavery into the territories,
and no reopening of the slave trade. On the first ballot,
Seward had one hundred and seventy-three and one-half
votes, and Lincoln followed with one hundred and two. On
the second, Seward had one hundred and eighty-four and a
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
half, and Lincoln one hundred and eighty-one. The excitement
was tremendous. The number necessary for a choice
was two hundred and thirty-three. On the third ballot, Lincoln
had two hundred and thirty-one and a half, while Seward
had fallen back to one hundred and eighty. There was no resisting
the tide. Before the figures were removed, a delegate
from Ohio sprang upon his chair, and reported a change of four
votes from Chase to Lincoln. In an instant, one of the tellers
shouted, “Lincoln!” whereupon it seemed as if the ten thousand
persons present had become insane with enthusiasm. A
cannon on the roof of the hall announced the result to the city
in accordance with a preconcerted understanding. The chairman
of the New York delegation, William M. Evarts, then
moved that the nomination be made unanimous. This harmonious
result was welcomed by Republicans in all parts of
the country.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s437'></a><span class='bold'>437. The Presidential Canvass.</span>—The campaign was conducted
with a vigor and an enthusiasm that had not been
known since 1840. Lincoln made no speeches and wrote no
letters for publication, but made himself accessible at Springfield
to all callers who might care to meet him. But such a
course was not followed by the Democrats. No progress was
made toward reunion. On the contrary, the Breckinridge, or
Southern wing, waged unrelenting war on Douglas, both in
discussion and in the promise of distribution of patronage.
Douglas was not slow to retaliate. He entered at once on an
extensive campaigning tour and made speeches in many states,
both North and South.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s438'></a><span class='bold'>438. The Position of Douglas.</span>—The most important utterance
of all the campaign was one made by Douglas at Norfolk,
Virginia. He was asked in writing whether he was in favor
of maintaining the Union by force. He declared, without a
moment’s hesitation: “I answer emphatically that it is the
duty of the President of the United States, and all others in
authority under him, to enforce the laws, and I, as in duty
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
bound by my oath of fidelity to the Constitution, would do
all in my power to aid the Government of the United States
in maintaining the laws against all resistance to them, come
from what quarter it might. In other words, I think the President,
whoever he may be, should treat all attempts to break up
the Union, by resistance to the laws, as Old Hickory treated
the nullifiers in 1832.” The South made the fatal mistake of
supposing that this view was not held by a large majority of the
Democrats of the North. In reality, it was this view, so frankly
expressed by Douglas, that finally united an overwhelming
majority of the Northern Democrats in supporting, with more
or less heartiness, the Republicans in the great war that was
at hand.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s439'></a><span class='bold'>439. Result of the Election.</span>—In the election, Lincoln received
one hundred and eighty electoral votes; Breckinridge,
seventy-two; Bell, thirty-nine; and Douglas, twelve. Lincoln
received the vote of every free state except New Jersey, whose
vote was divided, four electors voting for Lincoln, and three
for Douglas. Douglas, in addition to the three votes from
New Jersey, received nine from Missouri; those of the other
Southern states were divided between Breckinridge and Bell.</p>

<h3 id='s440a'>SECESSION OF THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s440'></a><span class='bold'>440. Secession of South Carolina and Other States.</span>—At the
time of the election, the legislature of South Carolina was in
session. As soon as the result was known, that body called a
State Convention to meet and consider the situation. The
Convention met, and on the 20th of December, repealed the
Act ratifying the Constitution, and declared that the union
between South Carolina and the other states was dissolved.
Before Lincoln’s inauguration, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas, and Florida had followed the example of
South Carolina. They seized all the military posts of the
United States within their territory, a procedure that had been
made easy by the strange doctrine of Buchanan that, although
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
a state had no right to secede, the United States had no
right to prevent it from seceding and carrying United States
property with it.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s441'></a><span class='bold'>441. Opposition to the Seceders.</span>—The first step in opposition
to the seceders was taken by Major Robert Anderson of Kentucky,
who abandoned the untenable Fort Moultrie of which he
was in charge, and posted himself in Fort Sumter, which, being
on an island, could be more easily held for the Union if succor
were speedily provided by the authorities in Washington.
The latter were vacillating, however, or else were in open
sympathy with the secessionists. The President was at least
strong enough to resist the demand of the South Carolina
Commissioners that Anderson should be ordered to evacuate
Fort Sumter, and he also refused to receive further communications
from the commissioners. Finally, too, he surrounded
himself with a loyal Cabinet, through resignations which were
voluntary, but should have been demanded. Chief among his
new advisers were Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania, Secretary
of State; Edwin M. Stanton of Pennsylvania, Attorney-General;
Joseph Holt of Kentucky, Secretary of War; and
John A. Dix<a id='r195'/><a href='#f195' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[195]</span></sup></a> of New York, Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s442'></a><span class='bold'>442. The Star of the West.</span>—The reorganized Cabinet insisted
on reënforcing Anderson at Fort Sumter, but the attempt was
made only with a merchant steamer, the <span class='it'>Star of the West</span>, which
turned back at the fire of the Carolinian batteries (January
9, 1861). This rather weak step served the Southerners with
matter for indignation and for charges that the North was
bent on war. It also led to the discovery that Jacob Thompson
of Mississippi, the Secretary of the Interior, had warned
the South Carolinians of the intended reënforcement. Thompson
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
at once resigned, and Buchanan arranged a sort of armistice
with the Southerners still in Congress, by which he was
to be allowed to finish his administration in peace, it being
understood that the forts should be neither reënforced nor
captured.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s443'></a><span class='bold'>443. Last Attempts at Compromise.</span>—In the course of 1860 and
the early part of 1861, several attempts were made to reach
a compromise. The most famous of these was the one introduced
by Senator Crittenden, of Kentucky, December 18, 1860.
He proposed a constitutional amendment in which the main
clauses should prohibit slavery north of 36° 30′, but protect it,
as other property is protected, in all territory south of that line,
and should arrange for admitting states north or south of that
line, with or without slavery, as their constitutions might
provide. While the Compromise was before a committee of
thirteen, of which Seward was the most prominent Republican
and Jefferson Davis the most prominent Democrat, Seward
was offered by Lincoln the Secretaryship of State. Lincoln
wrote, “On the territorial question, I am inflexible.” In
further explanation he said
that the adoption of the
Compromise would only
postpone the difficulties
that then confronted the
nation. In the committee,
the Republicans voted
against the Compromise,
and Davis of Mississippi,
and Toombs of Georgia,
voted with them. The Republicans
were responsible
for its defeat. On January
3, 1861, Crittenden proposed that the whole subject of his
Compromise be submitted to a direct vote of the people.
Douglas powerfully supported the proposition; but Davis, in
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
an elaborate speech in behalf of the South, made it apparent
that compromise was now impossible. Other minor attempts
met with similar failure.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s444'></a><span class='bold'>444. Southern Confederacy Formed.</span>—Soon after the Ordinances
of Secession were passed by the several Southern
states, their representatives,
with only
two exceptions, withdrew,
one by one, from
Congress. The Secession
Conventions appointed
delegates in
number equal to their
former senators and representatives
at Washington,
and the members
so appointed met
at Montgomery, Alabama,
February 4, 1861,
to form a Southern
Confederacy. President
Buchanan offered
no opposition to this
movement. The body
was soon organized by
the choice of Howell
Cobb, of Georgia, as chairman. A provisional government for
one year, under the name, “The Confederate States of America,”
was adopted February 8, and the following day Jefferson
Davis<a id='r196'/><a href='#f196' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[196]</span></sup></a> was chosen President of the Confederacy, and
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
Alexander H. Stephens,<a id='r197'/><a href='#f197' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[197]</span></sup></a> of Georgia, Vice President. The
Constitution, as elaborated and completed, was adopted on
the 11th of March. Stephens, as Vice President, was formally
inaugurated on the 10th of February, and Davis, as
President, on the 18th. Thus the Confederate government was
fully installed two weeks before the inauguration of Lincoln.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s445'></a><span class='bold'>445. Stephens and Lincoln on the Causes of the War.</span>—Soon
after the inaugural ceremonies in the South, the newly chosen
Vice President, in a speech
at Savannah, explained the
grounds of secession. After
referring to Thomas Jefferson,
he said: “The prevailing
ideas entertained by
him and most of the leading
statesmen of the time
of the formation of the old
Constitution, were that the
enslavement of the African
was in violation of the laws
of nature; that it was
wrong in principle, socially,
morally, and politically.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Our government is founded
upon exactly the opposite
idea; its foundations are
laid, its corner-stone rests upon the great truth that the negro
is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
the superior race—is his natural and normal condition. This,
our new government, is the first, in the history of the world,
based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral
truth.”<a id='r198'/><a href='#f198' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[198]</span></sup></a> For the purpose of reducing the causes of the war
to a nutshell, this utterance may be placed in contrast with
the summary of the Northern views by Lincoln: “Slavery
is wrong and must not be extended. No state can in any
way get out of the Union without the consent of the others.
It is the duty of the President and of the other public functionaries
to run the machine as it is.” At about the same
time, in answer to an inquiry, Lincoln wrote to Stephens:
“You think slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while
we think it is wrong, and ought to be restricted. That, I suppose,
is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference
between us.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s446'></a><span class='bold'>446. Misunderstandings and Mistakes.</span>—While the South
believed, as had so often been claimed by Calhoun and Davis,
that it had a right to secede and that the North had no right
to oppose secession with force, each side was deceived in regard
to the strength and real purpose of the other. The South
made the mistake of believing that the Douglas Democrats
would not unite with the Republicans, and the North greatly
underestimated the determination and the readiness for war
on the part of the South. Neither side seems to have more
than half believed that the other side would fight. As the
South was far more ready than the North, it was certain that,
in case of war, the South would gain the first victories. But
as the North had far greater resources, it was also certain
that, with equal skill and determination, the North would
in the end be successful. Each side held that its own
strength would prevent the other side from entering upon
war. Seward was so optimistic as to believe that as soon as
the North showed its determination, the South would yield,
and war would be “over in ninety days.” If each side had
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
thoroughly understood the other, probably no war would have
occurred. But, not understanding each other, “one side,” as
Lincoln once said, “would make war rather than let the
nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let
it perish.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s447'></a><span class='bold'>447. The Sections on the Eve of the Civil War.</span>—If the South
had been in a condition to reason calmly, the laying of the
Atlantic cable, through
the efforts of Cyrus W.
Field,<a id='r199'/><a href='#f199' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[199]</span></sup></a> might have convinced
its leaders that
it was useless to uphold
past ideals of government
and a belated
institution like slavery
in the face of advancing
civilization. The same
lesson might have been
taught them by the immense
growth of the
North and West since
1830. The increase in
area, due to the settlement
of the Oregon
dispute and to the territory
acquired from Mexico
by war and purchase,
had helped freedom
rather than slavery. Of
the 31,443,321 inhabitants of the whole country in 1860, only
a little over 12,250,000 resided in the slaveholding states, including
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
Missouri and Delaware, and of these twelve millions
slightly over a third were negroes, who were in the main slaves.
Over 3,500,000 persons lived in border states which did not join
the Confederacy; so that when the crisis came, only about
8,700,000 whites in the South were to be matched against the
19,000,000 whites of the North and West. The advantage on
the side of freedom was not really so great as these figures would
make it; for the Southerners could leave their slaves at work
and could flock to the front, while the Northern people had to
keep their farms and factories going as well as fight. But
when all allowances are made, the balance in favor of freedom
was very great. The contrast between the sections is rendered
all the more striking when we observe the great urban
growth in the North and West. New York City in 1860 had
about eight hundred thousand inhabitants; the South contained
only two fairly large cities,—New Orleans and Baltimore.
The foreign immigrants, nearly five million of whom
had entered the country since 1830, when immigration practically
began, saw even more clearly than many Americans
the differences between the sections, and settled mainly in the
North and West.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s448'></a><span class='bold'>448. Wealth of the Country.</span>—We have seen that in Jackson’s
day the character of the average American became more energetic,
and that the country entered upon an era of commercial
expansion which even the panic of 1837 could not permanently
check. The growth of manufacturing and of railroads had
been enormous, chiefly in the North and West. In 1860 one
billion dollars were invested in manufacturing, six billion five
hundred million in farming. In the latter form of wealth the
South, of course, had its share, since its cotton crops were very
valuable. But the cotton was shipped in northern vessels and
was exchanged for products not manufactured in the South.
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
In the matter of railroads, a great gain had been made since
1850, twenty of the thirty thousand miles operated in 1860
having been laid within the decade.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s449'></a><span class='bold'>449. Inventions.</span>—It is almost needless to say that American
inventiveness kept pace with the country’s growth in population
and wealth. Between 1830 and 1860, Cyrus H. McCormick
(1809–1884) invented his reaper, which revolutionized
farming; S. F. B. Morse (1791–1872) made the telegraph an
effective means of communication; Charles Goodyear (1800–1860)
succeeded in vulcanizing india rubber; and Elias Howe
(1819–1867) patented his sewing machine. The same epoch
was marked by the growth of express companies, the first use
of postage stamps, the perfection of the daguerreotyping process,
the use of anæsthetics, and the employment of steam fire
engines. When we remember further that this was the era of
such great scientists as Asa Gray (1810–1888) the botanist, J.
D. Dana (1813–1895) the mineralogist, Joseph Henry (1797–1878)
the physicist, and Louis Agassiz (1807–1873) the naturalist,
as well as of the great historians, William H. Prescott
(1796–1859), George Bancroft (1800–1891), and John Lothrop
Motley (1814–1877), and of Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow,
and other writers already mentioned, we can perceive that
the intellectual growth of the nation had kept pace with
its material development. Yet, with the exception of Commodore
Matthew F. Maury (18061—1873),—who won fame for his
work in physical geography, especially of the sea,—and of
Edgar Allan Poe, nearly every one of these scientists and
authors was a Northern man. From all points of view, therefore,
the odds were against the South at the beginning of the
great struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s450'></a><span class='bold'>450. From the Election to the Inauguration.</span>—While the
South, during the months between the election and the inauguration
of Lincoln, was setting up its new government and
preparing for war, the North could do nothing. President
Buchanan, as we have already seen, scarcely lifted a finger to
prevent the secession of the Southern states. There is even
reason for thinking that he encouraged it,<a id='r200'/><a href='#f200' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[200]</span></sup></a> although in the
main he was loyal. Howell Cobb of Georgia, Buchanan’s Secretary
of the Treasury, John B. Floyd of Virginia, Secretary
of War, as well as Secretary Thompson, actively and openly
sympathized with the Southern leaders and gave them constant
advice and assistance. Floyd even received Thomas F. Drayton,
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
the agent of South Carolina, and negotiated with him for the
sale of arms; and W. H. Trescott, the Assistant Secretary of
State, was in constant correspondence with Governor Gist, of
South Carolina, in regard to all plans for secession.<a id='r201'/><a href='#f201' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[201]</span></sup></a> This
activity at the South gave great alarm to the North. Lincoln
remained at Springfield until it was time to start for Washington
for the inauguration, but he was beset with demands for
an explanation of the policy which he would pursue. Though
he wrote numerous private letters, he positively refused to give
out a word for publication. His letters, since published, show
that he never wavered from his purpose to defend the property
of the United States government in the South. In the course
of his journey to Washington, he made several speeches that
showed remarkable firmness, united with a deep sense of
responsibility. Hearing in Philadelphia, from two independent
sources, of a plot to assassinate him in Baltimore, he
reluctantly yielded to the urgent advice of his friends, and
secretly boarded a special train in order to elude possible
assassins by passing through Baltimore in the night.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s451'></a><span class='bold'>451. Selection of the Cabinet, and the Inauguration.</span>—Lincoln
had the matter of choosing a Cabinet long under consideration,
but its membership was not fully settled till the day before his
inauguration. His chief rivals for the Presidency were given
leading positions. The Secretary of State was W. H. Seward
of New York; Salmon P. Chase of Ohio became Secretary of
the Treasury; Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, Secretary of
War; Gideon P. Welles of Connecticut, Secretary of the
Navy. In his inaugural address, the President spoke with a
pathetic sense of his responsibility, but with great clearness
of conviction as to the nature of his duty. He declared that
he had “no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the
institution of slavery in the states” where it existed, and that
there would be “no bloodshed or violence unless” it were
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
“forced upon the national authority.” His purpose he defined
by saying, “The power confided to me will be used to hold,
occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the
government and to collect the duties and imposts.” Appealing
to his dissatisfied fellow countrymen, he said, “You have
no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while
I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect, and
defend it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s452'></a><span class='bold'>452. The Fall of Sumter.</span>—One after another, the military
posts in the South were taken possession of by the local
authorities. At Charleston, the Federal garrisons of two of the
other forts withdrew to Fort Sumter, in order to defend it.
But, even thus reënforced, it was short of ammunition and
provisions. Buchanan, in January, had ordered relief sent;
but as we have seen (§ <a href='#s442'>442</a>), the <span class='it'>Star of the West</span> was fired upon,
and turned back to New York. Lincoln, in accordance with
his firm but conciliatory policy, sent word to Governor Pickens,
of South Carolina, that he had made provision to send supplies
to Fort Sumter. The Governor decided at once to take the fort
before the supplies could arrive, and, under his orders, General
Beauregard opened fire upon it about four o’clock on the morning
of the 12th of April. Two days later, the commander of
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
the fort, Major Anderson, having exhausted food and ammunition,
was obliged to take down his flag and withdraw from his
post. No lives were lost
on either side. This action
of the South was a
strategic blunder, for it
enabled the North to enter
upon the war with an
enthusiasm which could
otherwise hardly have
been secured.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s453'></a><span class='bold'>453. First Call for
Troops.</span>—The firing upon
Sumter sent a thrill of patriotic determination throughout the
North. On the 15th of April, Lincoln issued a proclamation,
declaring that a combination against the Union had been formed,
and calling for an enlistment of seventy-five thousand men for
three months, “in order to suppress said combination and to
cause the laws to be duly executed.” He also called upon all
loyal citizens to aid and facilitate “this effort to maintain
the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National
Union.” The response was immediate and overwhelming.
Douglas, then upon his dying bed, dictated a letter, declaring
that the only course left for patriotic men was to sustain the
Union “against all assailants.” The course of Douglas unquestionably
did much to unite all parties in the North. In every
city and town mass meetings were instantly held and companies
and regiments were formed. Senator Chandler telegraphed:
“Michigan will send you fifty thousand men, if you
desire.” Indiana, whose quota was five thousand, telegraphed
that ten thousand were ready. So it was from every quarter
of the North. Men came in such numbers that instead of
seventy-five thousand, the War Department accepted more
than ninety-one thousand. In the South, the people were
likewise fired with enthusiasm and drawn nearer together.
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
There was, at first, an opposition to secession in Virginia, but
reluctance to allow troops to pass over her soil and the demand
that she should furnish her quota <span class='it'>against</span> the South,
turned the scale. Four of the border states, as they were then
called,—North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas,—now
passed Ordinances of Secession. Shortly after Virginia
seceded, April 17, the capital of the Confederacy was
transferred from Montgomery to Richmond.</p>

<h3 id='s454a'>MILITARY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE COMBATANTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s454'></a><span class='bold'>454. Comparative Numerical Strength.</span>—As we have seen
(§ <a href='#s447'>447</a>), the population of the seceded states was a little less
than nine millions, of whom about five and one-half millions
were whites; while the population of the other states was
about twenty-two millions. At the beginning of the war a
large proportion of the white adult males in the South was
brought into action through public opinion, and a little later, a
rigid conscription law, including all able-bodied men between
fifteen and fifty, was rigorously enforced. Old men, women,
boys, and slaves were left at home to furnish the necessary supplies.
Thus the South put forth almost its entire strength early
in the war, and the capture of territory and prisoners continually
lessened its resources; while the very opposite was the case
with the North. While the war was going on, the productive
industries of the Union states never flagged, and the population
continued to increase so that it was possible to have a larger
army at the end of the war than at the beginning. However,
all figures comparing the armies and the numbers present in
individual battles are somewhat misleading, from the fact that
in the Southern army teamsters and laborers on the supply
trains were generally slaves, not enumerated. Slaves were also
employed in the trenches. In the Northern armies, on the
other hand, these forms of service were generally rendered
by enlisted men.
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s455'></a><span class='bold'>455. Comparative Industries.</span>—The South was essentially an
agricultural region, depending for its income chiefly upon its
exports of cotton and tobacco. If a blockade could be stringently
enforced, this source of revenue must necessarily be cut
off. But that was not all. The supplies which the South had
been in the habit of importing could not now be procured
except at enormous prices and in very small quantities. A
few facts will show the significance of this condition. In
1860, the exports of cotton amounted in value to about two
hundred millions of dollars, but before the end of the war,
the annual income from that source was not more than four
million dollars. The inducement to run the blockade may be
inferred from the fact that the best cotton could be bought in
Charleston at four or five cents a pound, while in Liverpool,
where the American supply had been cut off, the price per
pound was no less than two dollars and a half. Prospect of
profit led to the most daring risks. Insurance on blockade
running vessels rose nearly a thousand per cent, and the wages
of sea captains plying between Nassau and Southern ports
increased from thirty to one thousand pounds sterling per
month. As we shall hereafter see, prices rose enormously in
the South, and the suffering on the part of many became
almost intolerable. This condition of affairs might have been
prevented, if the South before the war had given itself to
the development of varied industries. But, with all the able-bodied
men in the field, the sudden establishment of industrial
activity was plainly out of the question. In the North,
on the other hand, the conditions were very different. At the
beginning of the war, a high protective tariff was established,
partly to provide an increased revenue, and partly to encourage
the rapid spread of home industries. The consequence was
great industrial activity throughout the entire period of the
war. As the Northern ports were all open, intercourse with
foreign markets was easy, and the rise of prices was not so
great anywhere as to cause considerable inconvenience. In
fact, the North grew steadily in wealth during the war.
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s456'></a><span class='bold'>456. Financial Methods in the North.</span>—The cost of a great war
is always so enormous that all the resources of taxation and
credit must be resorted to. The necessities of the North were
peculiarly stringent in 1861, owing to the fact that during
Buchanan’s administration the Treasury was nearly bankrupt
(§ <a href='#s423'>423</a>). As soon as the war began, the financial pressure was
felt throughout the country, and before the end of 1861, the
banks everywhere were obliged to suspend specie payment. A
few months later, Congress authorized an issue of $150,000,000
of paper currency, and made it legal tender for the payment of
all debts. In 1863, the amount of such notes was increased to
$450,000,000; and from the color of the ink used, they came
to be known as “greenbacks.” As they were not redeemable in
gold at any specific time, the price of gold began to rise as soon
as the first issue was made, and increased as the war progressed,
until, in 1864, the premium on gold reached its highest point,—two
hundred and eighty-five per cent. Of course, this premium
was not an increase in the value of gold, but a decrease in the
value of paper currency. As the current money became cheap,
the prices of commodities naturally rose. It has been ascertained
that the average increase in the prices of real estate, rents,
and goods was about ninety per cent, while the increase in the
price of labor was only about sixty per cent. Thus it is evident
that the men of means profited most, or suffered least, by the inflation,
while the laborer suffered most. Another source of income
was the issue of government bonds at a high rate of interest.
These amounted before the end of the war to $2,850,000,000.
As during the first years of the contest the success of the
North, and consequently the ability of the government to pay,
appeared uncertain, it was difficult to sell the bonds except at
a considerable discount.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s457'></a><span class='bold'>457. National Banks.</span>—An ingenious method of disposing of
a large part of the bonds was devised. A law was enacted in
February, 1863, authorizing any five persons to organize a
National Bank on easy conditions. Except in very small places,
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
such a bank was required to have a capital of at least one
hundred thousand dollars and to deposit, with the Treasury at
Washington, bonds to the amount of one-third of its capital.
The government would then issue notes to the bank to the
amount of ninety per cent of such deposit, such notes to be
used by the bank for the purposes of circulating currency, and
to be redeemable by the government in greenbacks. The response
was at first slow; but in 1864 a new impulse was given
to the movement by an act levying a tax of ten per cent on
the circulation of state banks—a law designed to compel state
banks to become national. By these measures, a safe and
abundant currency was provided. In addition to these devices,
a high internal revenue was levied, an income tax was provided,
and tariff duties, as the war went on, were greatly increased.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s458'></a><span class='bold'>458. Finances in the South.</span>—No such fertile devices were
possible in the South. Bonds were issued, but, as there was
little or no capital seeking investment, no market at home
could be found, and foreign capitalists would not run great
risks till the issue of the war could be predicted with some
confidence. The government then issued notes payable six
months after the close of the war. With the diminishing prospects
of the South, these notes rapidly declined in value, till
they became practically worthless. Then the Confederate Congress
authorized the army to seize provisions and supplies
wherever they could find them, and to offer in payment bonds
or notes at prices to be fixed every ninety days. Under this
financial régime, prices rose enormously, and the consequent
suffering of those who did not occupy their own estates or were
not in the army or the service of the government, was well-nigh
indescribable.</p>

<h3 id='s459a'>DESCRIPTION OF THE SEAT OF WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s459'></a><span class='bold'>459. General Features of the War.</span>—Without some knowledge
of the physical characteristics of the country, it will not
be easy to understand why the war progressed so slowly as it
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
did in the East and so rapidly in the West. As the South had
broken away from the Union, and the North was trying to
bring the seceded states back under national authority, the
North was, necessarily, the attacking party, while the South
had merely to act on the defensive. Though two important
efforts were made by the South to transfer the field of operations
to the North, these were both unsuccessful, and therefore
the war, in all its larger features, was fought in the South.
This fact makes it necessary to look for a moment at the
physiographic features of the field of action.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s460'></a><span class='bold'>460. Physical Features in the East.</span>—The Alleghany Mountains
and the Mississippi River divided the Confederacy into
three somewhat distinct parts. The eastern portion, which lies
between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic, is characterized by a
succession of rivers that rise in the mountains and flow in a
southeasterly direction nearly parallel with the Potomac and
James. To advance through Virginia to Richmond, it was
possible for the Union forces to go by water to the mouth of
the James and then ascend along the river, or to cross
the Rappahannock, the Rapidan, the York, and the Chickahominy,
besides a large number of smaller streams which
were sometimes swollen to the volume of navigable rivers.
Much of the intervening region, moreover, was swampy,
and at times almost impassable. East of the Alleghanies,
the subordinate range known as the Blue Ridge provides
a fertile, intervening valley, through which the Shenandoah
flows northward into the Potomac at Harper’s Ferry.
This Valley of Virginia, however, near the northern end, is subdivided
by a low range of mountains in such a way as to enable
an army driven down one side to retreat up the other.
Across the Blue Ridge at Manassas Gap, a railroad connects
the Valley with the eastern portion of Virginia and makes it
possible to transfer troops rapidly from one side to the other.
At Manassas, this railroad crosses an important Southern line
which runs from Washington to Richmond and Lynchburg,
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
and to the far South. This crossing, therefore, was of the first
strategic importance in the war, and was naturally the first
point of collision.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s461'></a><span class='bold'>461. Physical Features of the West.</span>—West of the Alleghanies
the water courses, in some respects, were of even more
importance than in the East. The Cumberland River, which
rises in the mountains of the same name, flows southwest, and
then, turning sharply to the north, empties into the Ohio some
miles above Cairo. The Tennessee flows in the same general
direction, but bends so far south as to reach Alabama and
Mississippi, and then, turning northward and flowing through
Tennessee and Kentucky in a course nearly parallel with the
Mississippi, though in an opposite direction, discharges its
waters into the Ohio. As railroads were few and other roads
were poor, these navigable waters were of the utmost importance
to the side that should be able to command them. Both
antagonists recognized this fact, and, therefore, the first contest
in this region was for command of these rivers. Soon after the
war began, the Unionists took Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio,
and the Confederates constructed Forts Henry and Donelson, on
the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, at points not far from the
Ohio, where the rivers were so near each other that either fort
could easily reënforce the other. In this way each side hoped
to gain command of the rivers for purposes of transportation.
The Mississippi also was strongly fortified by the Confederates
at Memphis, at Island Number 10, at Vicksburg, and at other
points of less importance. West of the Mississippi, the physical
features of the country were of less military consequence.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s462'></a><span class='bold'>462. First Bloodshed.</span>—Among those in the North who had
foreseen the conflict, one of the foremost was Governor John A.
Andrew, of Massachusetts. Inaugurated early in January, 1861,
he had set about preparing for hostilities by organizing the
state militia and by purchasing arms in Europe. Only four
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
days after the call for troops, therefore, the 6th Massachusetts
Regiment was ready to move to Washington. While passing
through Baltimore, the regiment was attacked by a mob and
several men were killed. This was the first bloodshed of the war.
The road through Baltimore was closed, and all trains with men
and supplies were for several months obliged to pass around the
city by way of Annapolis. But this was not the worst. The
railroad from Annapolis to Washington was torn up and every
telegraph line from Washington to the North was cut. Exit
from the capital in any direction
was, for a time, made impossible.
With the news that
Virginia had seceded, came the
rumor that a large Southern
force was on the march to take
Washington. General Winfield
Scott, then in command
as general in chief of the
United States armies, placed
barricades about all the public
buildings, and distributed the few guns he had at the
various approaches to the city. There were only twenty-five
hundred troops at his disposal. But officers and men in
the departments were brought into service, and many citizens
enlisted. The women and children were ordered out of town.
During all this terrible excitement and anxiety, a committee
from Baltimore appeared before the President and protested
that the soil of Maryland should not be “polluted” by troops
designed to invade the South. Lincoln replied, “We must
have troops, and, as they can neither crawl under Maryland
nor fly over it, they must come across it.” The alarming
rumor proved to have no foundation. The South was not
ready for an attack upon the capital.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s463'></a><span class='bold'>463. The Border States.</span>—The great fears naturally felt with
regard to the secession of other border states besides Virginia
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
were gradually relieved. This was caused partly by the wise
management of Lincoln, partly by the unexpected enthusiasm
throughout the North in responding to the call for troops, and
partly by the firmness of the Union sympathizers in those states.
Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri did not secede;
but while these states thus remained in the Union, the people
were divided in their sympathies, some going into one army, and
some into the other. Though Tennessee seceded and joined the
Confederacy, many of her people, especially in the Cumberland
Mountains, were stanch supporters of the Union throughout the
war. On the other hand, in southern Indiana and Illinois there
were many sympathizers with the South, and nothing but the
ability and the energy of the governors of those states and the
intense loyalty of the Unionists kept up the full quota of their
troops. In Virginia, while the people in the eastern part of the
state were generally Secessionists, a majority of those west of
the mountains were adherents of the Union. When, therefore,
Virginia withdrew, the people of the western portion voted to
break away from the rest of the state, and on December 31,
1862, Congress, with apparently more regard to necessity than
to the Constitution, admitted the region to the Union as West
Virginia.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s464'></a><span class='bold'>464. Foreign Recognition.</span>—On May 13, 1861, Great Britain
issued a “Proclamation of Neutrality,” which, in effect, recognized
the Confederates as belligerents, and this example was
soon imitated by the other European states. Thus the Confederates
obtained the right to have war vessels, and to take
refuge for repairs and needed supplies in foreign harbors.
The consular agents of the United States reported that Southern
agents were buying arms wherever they could be obtained in
Europe.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s465'></a><span class='bold'>465. Equipment and Further Preparation.</span>—In the beginning
of the war, though enlistments were rapid, preparations for
an advance were necessarily slow. The Southern ports were declared
blockaded, but the North had not enough ships on hand
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
with which to make the blockade effective. Coasting vessels
of all kinds were rapidly brought into the service, supplies had
to be collected, and troops had to be equipped and drilled.
The Confederates were more rapidly organized, because their
preparations for war had been much more advanced when the
war began, although they, too, were short of arms and powder.
Before the North was ready to move, the Confederacy had formed
a strong line across Virginia from Harper’s Ferry to Norfolk.
It had also placed strong fortifications along the Mississippi
River, the Mexican border, and about the Atlantic ports. A
little later the construction of Forts Henry and Donelson, on
the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, protected the northern
frontiers. Thus the Confederacy was nearly surrounded with
a line of defenses. Early in May, when the Northern troops
reached the line of action, skirmishing began, but no important
engagement occurred before July. On the 4th of July, Congress
met in special session. Lincoln, in his message, after reviewing
the situation, said: “This issue embraces more than
the fate of these United States. It presents to the whole family
of man the question whether a constitutional republic or
democracy—a government of the people by the same people—can
or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own
domestic foes.” Congress at once authorized the President, at
his discretion, to call out five hundred thousand volunteers,
and gave him all the powers necessary to carry on the war.</p>

<h3 id='s466a'>MILITARY MOVEMENTS OF 1861.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s466'></a><span class='bold'>466. Movements in West Virginia.</span>—Early in the summer of
1861, General George B. McClellan advanced from Ohio into
western Virginia, and in less than a month succeeded in driving
the Confederates out of that mountainous region. A little later,
General Robert E. Lee, in command of an insufficient Confederate
force, and in an inclement season, attempted to recover
the ground lost, but he was successfully resisted by General
Rosecrans, and the district remained in the hands of the Union.
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s467'></a><span class='bold'>467. The Battle of Bull Run, or Manassas.</span>—Largely in consequence
of McClellan’s successes in West Virginia, there was
a great popular outcry in the North for an advance. “On to
Richmond!” was the watchword of many of the influential newspapers.
General Scott at length reluctantly consented to a forward
movement. About thirty-five miles south of Washington,
the railroad from the
Shenandoah Valley, passing
through the mountains,
crosses the road which
runs from Richmond to
Washington. The point,
therefore, was one of such
strategic importance that
it enabled the army holding
it to move rapidly to
the East or West, as well
as to the North or South.
It was here, at Manassas
Junction, that the Confederate
force was concentrated
under Gen. P. G. T.
Beauregard.<a id='r202'/><a href='#f202' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[202]</span></sup></a> The Union
army, under General McDowell,
on July 21, crossed Bull Run, a small stream near
Manassas, and advanced to an attack. At the beginning of
the battle, McDowell had some success; but, in the afternoon,
the Union army, made up chiefly of raw recruits, was
thrown into a panic, owing to a reënforcement of the Confederates,
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
and fled in great disorder towards Washington.
About eighteen thousand men were engaged on each side.
The Confederates lost about two thousand, while the loss
of the Unionists was nearly three thousand.<a id='r203'/><a href='#f203' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[203]</span></sup></a> Both armies
were temporarily disorganized by the battle. On the following
day, McClellan was called from West Virginia and put in command
of all the forces from the mountains to the sea. In
November, General Scott was compelled by age to give up his
post, and McClellan succeeded him as general in chief of all
the Union forces. Neither army was yet in condition to make
an advance.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s468'></a><span class='bold'>468. Ball’s Bluff.</span>—The Confederates, however, strengthened
their line in the vicinity of Harper’s Ferry, and in October a
Union force of about two thousand men was defeated at
Ball’s Bluff, and its commander, the brilliant Colonel Baker of
Oregon, was killed. Before the end of the season the Union
army was increased by additional enlistments to nearly two
hundred thousand men, and the autumn and winter months
were passed in fortifying the lines, drilling the recruits, and
bringing together supplies.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s469'></a><span class='bold'>469. Lincoln’s Strategic Plans.</span>—Lincoln said at the very
beginning of the war that four things were essential to ultimate
success, and all his plans were directed accordingly.
First, the army must defend Washington, and, if possible,
press on and take Richmond. Second, the border states must,
at all hazards, be prevented from seceding. Third, the Mississippi
River must be opened, in order to give the West communication
with the sea and to cut off the Confederates from
western supplies. And fourth, the blockade must be made as
effective as possible, to prevent European supplies from reaching
the South.
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span></p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Nathaniel Lyon.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s470'></a><span class='bold'>470. The Contest in Missouri.</span>—In the West special efforts
were made by the Union forces to hold Missouri. Sentiment in
the state was divided. General John C. Frémont (§ <a href='#s417'>417</a>) was
early appointed to the command of the Western Department.
He entered upon his duties July 25, with headquarters at St.
Louis; but great frauds were soon developed in his department,
and he was unable to furnish the necessary supplies to
the army. His department was further discredited by an unauthorized
order freeing
the slaves, which
President Lincoln
promptly rescinded.
But notwithstanding
the confusion at headquarters,
General Nathaniel
Lyon,<a id='r204'/><a href='#f204' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[204]</span></sup></a> one of
the most promising of
Union officers, conducted
affairs in the
field with great energy
and skill. He pushed
the Confederates out
of the northern and
central parts of the
state; but near the
southern line, they
received reënforcements
from Arkansas
and Texas, and advanced
under General Price. The forces met, August 10, at
Wilson’s Creek, near Springfield. Price had 10,175 men,
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
with fifteen guns, while Lyon had 5400, with sixteen guns.
Lyon’s left was commanded by General Franz Sigel,<a id='r205'/><a href='#f205' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[205]</span></sup></a> who passed
around the right flank of the enemy and attacked in the
rear. Lyon, at the head of the main army, led the advance
with great gallantry, swinging his hat as he went. After being
twice wounded, he still pressed on, but soon fell from a third
wound, which proved mortal. Sigel’s force was cut off and
routed. Lyon’s main army held its ground, but, in the night,
the Union force was obliged to retire to Springfield. The
Unionists lost about twelve hundred, the Confederates about
a thousand.<a id='r206'/><a href='#f206' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[206]</span></sup></a> A major part of the Union force now retreated
to Raleigh, where they remained for the winter. Meanwhile,
early in September, the “Irish Brigade,” under Colonel J. A.
Mulligan, distinguished itself at Lexington, with about 2780
men, against General Price, with a besieging army of about
18,000 men and sixteen cannon. Though Mulligan and his
followers were obliged finally to surrender, it was not till
after three days of most desperate fighting.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s471'></a><span class='bold'>471. Halleck succeeds Frémont.</span>—In October, Missouri was
visited by the Secretary of War and the Adjutant General, for
the purpose of investigating the condition of affairs, of which
many complaints had reached Washington. Everything was
found to be in dire confusion, owing to the inability of Frémont
to administer successfully so large a field. General
Frémont was consequently superseded by General Henry W.
Halleck, who, before the end of the year, without fighting a
battle, gained possession of the entire state.</p>

<h3 id='s472a'>INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s472'></a><span class='bold'>472. The Trent Affair.</span>—Toward the close of the year 1861,
an event occurred which nearly involved the Union in a war
with Great Britain. In November, Captain Wilkes, a United
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
States officer, in command of the <span class='it'>San Jacinto</span>, boarded a British
mail steamer, <span class='it'>The Trent</span>, and took from her James M. Mason
of Virginia and John Slidell of Louisiana, who were bound for
Europe as Confederate commissioners. The right to stop and
search the vessels of neutrals in time of war had long been
maintained by Great Britain. The “Right of Search,” as we
have seen, had been one of the causes of the War of 1812.
Though often protested against, it had been generally maintained,
but at the close of the Crimean War the Great Powers
of Europe agreed, at the Peace of Paris, in 1856, to abandon it.
To this agreement the United States, not being a member of
the Congress, had not been a party, and was, therefore, not
bound by it. The British government, however, insisted
that the European agreement should be binding upon the
United States, and immediately demanded the surrender of
Mason and Slidell. Troops and vessels of war were at once
sent over to Canada, and great excitement was the result.
The officials of the United States replied that, although not a
party to the agreement of 1856, their government had always
been opposed to the “Right of Search,” and in accordance
with its own principles would give up the prisoners.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s473'></a><span class='bold'>473. Feeling engendered by the Trent Affair.</span>—The incident
left an angry feeling in the North toward Great Britain, for it
was universally felt that the British government had shown
an unmistakable partiality for the South. This feeling was
further aggravated by the habitual attitude of that important
newspaper, the London <span class='it'>Times</span>. Its offensive editorial utterances,
which were generally thought to be inspired by Lord
Palmerston, the Prime Minister, were the source of a vast
amount of ill feeling for more than a generation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s474'></a><span class='bold'>474. Results of the First Year.</span>—The outcome of the first
year in the field was favorable to the Confederates. The
Union side had lost Fort Sumter, Big Bethel, Bull Run,
Ball’s Bluff, Carthage, Wilson’s Creek, and Belmont. With
the exception of some small successes in West Virginia, there
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
had been disasters in every quarter. To a superficial observer,
therefore, success seemed to favor the South, and the attitude
of England was easily accounted for. But there were other
considerations to be taken into account. The tactful diplomacy
of Lincoln and the irresistible energy of the Union
sentiment had saved the states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky,
Missouri, and a part of Virginia from secession, and
these results ought, perhaps, to be regarded as more than
equivalent to the Confederate successes in the field. Not less
important were the Union successes in closing the Confederate
ports. The blockade was growing to be so complete as to prevent
the exportation of cotton and tobacco, and thus to cut off
the most important source of Confederate income. Meanwhile,
there was great commercial activity between the Union states
and Europe, and the government was easily and amply supplied
with men and money.</p>

seceding. Thompson described, according to this authority, an interview

<p class='pindent'><a id='s475'></a><span class='bold'>475. Secretary Edwin M. Stanton.</span>—The first very important

Cameron, who had been a candidate for the Presidential nomination,
had been taken into the Cabinet under the policy
already referred to (§ <a href='#s451'>451</a>), but the duties soon proved too
severe for his energy and his years. He was appointed Minister
to Russia; and the vacant position was given to Stanton,
who, as a War Democrat, had shown his ability and his spirit as
Attorney-General in Buchanan’s reorganized Cabinet. Stanton
at once put new life into the War Department. He was, at
times, exceedingly disagreeable in his methods, but he was the
terror of evil doers; and to the end of the war his marvelous
energy and remarkable administrative ability made themselves
felt in every branch of the service. It is doubtful if there has
been any greater Minister of War in modern times.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s476'></a><span class='bold'>476. Military Organization in the West.</span>—Activities in the field
began with very vigorous movements in the West. The Confederates,
under General Albert Sidney Johnston (§ <a href='#s478'>478</a>), had
established a strong line in southern Kentucky, extending from

Columbus to Mill Spring. They had also constructed, as
already described (§ <a href='#s461'>461</a>), two strong forts in Tennessee, just
south of the Kentucky
line,—Fort Henry on
the Tennessee River,
and Fort Donelson on
the Cumberland. The
organization of the
Northern army in the
West introduced a
change in the spring
of 1862. The Department
of the Mississippi,
which included
Missouri, Arkansas,
and so much of Kentucky
as was west of
the Cumberland River,
under Major General
H. W. Halleck, and the
Department of the
Ohio, which included
the eastern parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, under Major General
Don Carlos Buell, were consolidated on the 11th of March,
1862, into one department, and placed under Halleck, who thus
received command of all the forces throughout the West, consisting
of somewhat more than one hundred thousand men.

<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
war as colonel, had been advanced to brigadier general in consequence
of a prompt and successful seizure of Cairo, and
was now, though under the direction of Halleck, in command
of the middle branch of the army, while Buell commanded the
eastern section.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s477'></a><span class='bold'>477. First Advances.</span>—The first advance in Kentucky was
made by one of Buell’s divisions under General George H.
Thomas, who, on the 19th of January, defeated a force of
about equal numbers under General Zollicoffer at Mill Spring
and drove it back into Tennessee. Rear Admiral A. H. Foote,
with a fleet of gunboats, in February advanced up the Tennessee
River, and, after a severe engagement, took Fort Henry, with the
commanding general and a part of the garrison as prisoners.
Grant, who arrived with his army at about the same time,
marched rapidly across the country and surrounded Fort Donelson,
on the Cumberland. After making rapid preparations
for a siege, he carried the outer works of the fort by storm, and
then refused to accept any terms but “unconditional surrender.”
He took some fifteen thousand prisoners (February 16), including
two generals, and about twenty thousand stand of arms.
This was the first great victory for the North, and the skill
and vigor shown attracted the attention of the whole country.
The Confederate line was in consequence so broken that the
troops of the Confederacy were obliged to draw back into
southern Tennessee. The Union forces soon occupied Nashville,
and President Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson, a
prominent Tennessee Unionist, as military governor. Grant
advanced to Nashville without waiting for orders, or even
reporting the nature of his movement to Halleck. The consequence
was a formal complaint of Halleck to McClellan, who
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
had now taken the place of Scott as commanding general of
all the armies of the United States. McClellan, in reply,
authorized Halleck to “arrest Grant and put C. F. Smith in
command.” Halleck, however, realizing the immense popularity
which the “unconditional surrender” order and the success
of Grant had given the latter in the North, decided not
to exercise this authority, but ordered Grant back to Fort
Henry, and placed C. F. Smith in charge of the expedition
up the Tennessee. Grant was offended, and twice asked to
be relieved of further duty in that department. But when
at length Grant’s reports were received, they were so completely
satisfactory that Halleck telegraphed, expressing his
confidence, and Grant was satisfied. Grant’s aversion to sending
detailed reports of all his movements was such that the
Department at Washington sent to his headquarters a special
agent, Charles A. Dana, assistant editor of the <span class='it'>New York
Tribune</span> (afterward editor of the <span class='it'>Sun</span>), whose duty it was to
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
send a daily telegraphic report. Thereafter the government
was kept fully informed of Grant’s movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s478'></a><span class='bold'>478. Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing.</span>—Grant’s army, now
reënforced to about forty thousand men, crossed back to the
Tennessee River, and advanced
southward as far as
Pittsburg Landing, near the
border of Mississippi. This
point and Corinth, not far
below it, were of great
strategic importance, because
of the facility with
which troops and freight
could here be exchanged
between the Mississippi
and Tennessee rivers, and
because they commanded
the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad, which was one
of the Confederacy’s chief
means of transportation
from the Mississippi River
to the Atlantic. To seize
and hold these points was to prevent the transfer of troops and
supplies. Buell’s army was hurried forward to join Grant, but
the general in command of the Confederate force, Albert Sidney
Johnston,<a id='r209'/><a href='#f209' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[209]</span></sup></a> hastened to strike the army of Grant before Buell
could arrive. Grant’s advance extended a little west of Pittsburg
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
Landing, where the attack was first made. Early on
the morning of April 6, the Confederates, led by Johnston in
person, attacked with great vigor and drove the Union force
back upon the river. Sherman, who commanded this part of
the army, still held to the old notion that intrenchment in the
field made men cowardly, and, consequently, his force came
near being utterly routed. The progress of the Confederates,
however, was stubbornly resisted, not only by the troops, but
by the gunboats, which threw shells over the Union army into
the Confederate ranks. In the afternoon of the first day the
Confederates met with an irreparable loss in the death of
their very able leader, Johnston, who was killed on the field.
General Beauregard succeeded to the command. In the evening
Buell arrived with strong reënforcements, and at the dawn
of day on the 7th, Grant advanced to the attack. The Confederates
made a stout resistance, but were finally driven back
and forced to retreat to Corinth. The Unionists lost between
thirteen and fourteen thousand, and the Confederates between
ten and eleven thousand.<a id='r210'/><a href='#f210' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[210]</span></sup></a> The general notion prevailed in the
North that this greatest battle that had as yet been fought in
America, was saved only by the arrival of Buell. Grant’s confidence
in the outcome, even after the first day’s repulse, amounted
to a calmness that was interpreted by many as stolid indifference.<a id='r211'/><a href='#f211' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[211]</span></sup></a></p>

<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
on and took possession of Corinth. In March, a fleet of gunboats,
supported by an army under Major General John Pope,
after surmounting many and great difficulties, succeeded in
opening the Mississippi River from Cairo to Memphis. In June,
Memphis was taken, after one of the most remarkable naval
engagements of the war. The river was soon afterward opened
as far south as Vicksburg. The lower Mississippi had been
opened by the taking of New Orleans in April (§ <a href='#s488'>488</a>).</p>

south in Kentucky and Tennessee, General S. R. Curtis had
also been successful in the farther West. The Confederates,
under General Van Dorn, organized in the beginning of the
year a force of about sixteen thousand, including thirty-five
hundred Indians, for the purpose of recovering Missouri.
General Curtis, supported by
General Sigel, advanced across
the Arkansas line with ten
thousand five hundred Union
troops. The forces met at Pea
Ridge (March 6). The Confederates
were defeated; and
after that time no very important
battle occurred west of the
Mississippi River.</p>

General Braxton Bragg,<a id='r212'/><a href='#f212' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[212]</span></sup></a> a capable
commander, who now determined to break through the
Union lines, and, if possible, recover Tennessee and Kentucky for
the Confederacy. Advancing to the eastern part of Tennessee,
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
early in September, he turned suddenly north in the hope of
marching across Kentucky and taking Louisville; but Buell
advanced along a shorter line and reached Louisville before the
Confederates, thus saving the principal city of the state. After
much maneuvering, an indecisive battle was fought at Perryville,
October 8; but the Confederates were checked. They
were obliged to abandon their attempt to secure a permanent
foothold and had to
content themselves
with carrying south
long trains of supplies.
Though Buell’s
pursuit was not vigorous,
he drove Bragg
out of Kentucky. At
the end of the raid,
the Confederates set
up defenses at Chattanooga,
while the
headquarters of the
Union army were at
Nashville.</p>

Buell, advanced from Nashville with the purpose of dislodging
his opponent. The armies met in a great battle on Stone River,
a shallow stream which flowed between the armies, near Murfreesborough.
During the first day, December 31, the Unionists
were driven back, but during the second and third days,
they recovered their ground. On the night of January 2,
1863, the Confederates were obliged to withdraw from the
field, but the Unionists were too much crippled to follow.
The battle was a costly one to both sides, the Union loss
having been about thirteen thousand, and the Confederate
about ten thousand. Both armies soon went into winter
quarters. The battle left the control of central Tennessee
in the hands of the Unionists.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s483'></a><span class='bold'>483. Results in the West.</span>—The results of the campaigns in
the West were highly encouraging to the North. The Union
forces had kept possession of Missouri and had got control of
the larger part of Tennessee and of the Mississippi River as far
south as Vicksburg. The Confederates still had the advantage
of being strongly intrenched at Chattanooga, the point in eastern
Tennessee through which the railroads pass from Virginia
to the Southwestern states. The armies had fought with equal
bravery, but the balance of success was on the side of the
North.</p>

<h3 id='s484a'>THE WORK OF THE NAVY.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s484'></a><span class='bold'>484. Ironclads.</span>—In the East, the war was prosecuted, during
1862, partly by the navy and partly by the army. Before
the outbreak of hostilities, ironclad vessels had played practically
no part in naval warfare anywhere in the world.
Experiments in protecting vessels with iron had, indeed, been
made by the British and the French, but without much success.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
In the latter part of 1861, however, an event occurred which
effected a complete revolution in the construction of war ships.
The Confederates had secured at Norfolk the abandoned and
partly destroyed frigate <span class='it'>Merrimac</span>. They decided to cut off
the top of the vessel and build upon it a sort of Mansard
roof so heavily plated with iron and so sloping that it could
throw off the heaviest cannon shot. They also fitted up the
ship with an iron prow, or beak, put in powerful engines,
and filled the space within the roof with heavy guns. At
about the same time, Brigadier General A. W. Ellet, an engineer
in the Union army, devised and built in the West a fleet
of steam rams of similar construction, which did great execution
at the battle of Memphis.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s485'></a><span class='bold'>485. First Success of the Merrimac.</span>—On the 8th of March,
1862, the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> sailed out from Norfolk into Hampton
Roads. She there met a Union fleet, consisting of five of the
largest ships and a number of smaller vessels. The battle was
one-sided, and was soon over. The <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> with its prow sank
the <span class='it'>Cumberland</span> and then drove the other vessels ashore and
set several of them on fire. The whole fleet would have been
destroyed had not darkness come on. The guns of the wooden
ships made no impression whatever on the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span>. At
night this destructive Confederate boat withdrew to Norfolk,
intending to finish its work the next morning.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s486'></a><span class='bold'>486. The Merrimac and the Monitor.</span>—Fortunately for the
North, when the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> came out on the second day, she was
confronted by a craft still stranger in appearance than herself.
In the course of the winter, John Ericsson,<a id='r214'/><a href='#f214' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[214]</span></sup></a> a great
Swedish engineer, then in New York, had constructed a gunboat
which he called the <span class='it'>Monitor</span>. It consisted of the hull of
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
a vessel with a top as low and flat as a raft. Rising only a few
inches above the water, it was made enormously strong, in order
that it might carry very powerful engines, as well as its
very heavy armor of iron. On its deck was a low, broad iron
tower, thick enough to resist the heaviest shot, and large
enough to hold two of the
most powerful guns. This
tower, which was said to resemble
a cheese box on a raft,
was revolved by machinery
within the hull of the vessel.
Though the tonnage of the
<span class='it'>Monitor</span> was only nine hundred,
while that of the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span>,
owing to her heavy guns,
was thirty-five hundred, the
advantage was decidedly
with the <span class='it'>Monitor</span>. When
the two vessels came together,
they fought for four
hours with the utmost desperation.
Then the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> withdrew to Norfolk
and soon after was destroyed
by the Confederates themselves. The terror that had been felt
in all the seaboard cities at the end of the first day’s victories
of the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> was thus relieved, and a new era in naval
construction began.<a id='r215'/><a href='#f215' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[215]</span></sup></a></p>

several important events took place. Commodore Goldsborough
and Major General A. E. Burnside captured Roanoke Island in
February, and, a little later, Fort Pulaski on the Savannah
River. Several places in Florida also fell into Union hands.
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
By these captures, the blockade was made much easier and
more effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s488'></a><span class='bold'>488. Capture of New Orleans.</span>—The great event in the
extreme South was
the capture of New
Orleans. This city
was of much importance
to the Confederacy,
for it not
only controlled the
mouth of the Mississippi
River, but
also protected the
passage from Texas
to the Eastern
states. A naval expedition
designed
to attempt the capture
of the place
was fitted out under
Commodore D.
G. Farragut,<a id='r216'/><a href='#f216' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[216]</span></sup></a> with
auxiliary military
forces under Major
General B. F.
Butler. The expedition
set out
from Hampton Roads in February. The troops, some fifteen
thousand in number, landed at Ship Island, and remained
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
there until the fleet opened the river. The city was protected
by Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, with very
heavy guns, on opposite sides of the river. From one side to
the other, six massive chains were stretched; and connected
with these was a huge raft of logs, extending from shore to
shore and completely closing the passage. Above the raft
was a fleet of thirteen Confederate gunboats and an ironclad
floating battery. There were also several fire rafts, designed
to burn the Union ships in case they forced a passage. Farragut
bombarded the forts for a week without much effect, and
then determined to force his way through the obstructions.
One dark night several of the gunboats ran up to the raft
and succeeded in cutting the chains so as to open a passage.
A very desperate combat ensued. Farragut pushed forward
with fourteen vessels, protected with chains and sand bags
against the enemy’s fire. The movement of the ships was
made plain by bonfires lighted along the shore. The cannonading
from the works and the opposing ships was terrific; but
the Confederate fleet was finally destroyed and Farragut found
himself above the forts. The city was now at his mercy, and
it surrendered on April 25.</p>

Butler took command of New Orleans as military governor, and
Farragut’s fleet passed on and soon opened the river to the
vicinity of Vicksburg. The war governor with great difficulty
wrought order out of chaos by a policy that was much criticised
for its severity. One of the citizens defiantly pulled
down the American flag, whereupon the general, after the
offender had been duly convicted of the act, ordered him to be
hanged. In other ways, he made it evident that the authority
of the United States was not to be trifled with; but some of
his orders naturally gave much offense to the people of the
South. His services to the city from the point of view of
sanitation are, however, generally acknowledged to have been
very noteworthy.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s490'></a><span class='bold'>490. McClellan and the Army of the Potomac.</span>—In the East,
the campaigns of 1862 were far less successful for the Union
than were those in the West. McClellan,<a id='r217'/><a href='#f217' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[217]</span></sup></a> whose successes in
West Virginia had
brought him rapidly
forward, succeeded
Scott, in November,
1861, as general in
chief of all the armies.
While, during the winter,
he was successfully
organizing the forces
of the East, his direction
of the Western
armies was confusing
and unsatisfactory. For
this reason, and also
because of his attitude
toward the President,
which seemed to be
characterized by insubordination,
his authority was limited to the Army of the
Potomac. The number of parallel rivers and the swampy
nature of much of the ground between Washington and
Richmond, as already described (§ <a href='#s460'>460</a>), gave excellent
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
opportunities for defensive warfare, but made an offensive
campaign, especially in the vicinity of Richmond, exceedingly
difficult. The Federal government was in favor of a direct
advance, such as was afterwards made by Grant; but McClellan
strongly recommended a transfer of his army to the Peninsula
between the York and the James rivers, and an advance
upon Richmond from the southeast. Lincoln very reluctantly
yielded to this plan, which had the disadvantage of separating
McClellan from the forces that were to protect Washington.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s491'></a><span class='bold'>491. Unfortunate Division of Forces.</span>—Unfortunately, also,
this arrangement resulted in the Union’s having in the field
in the East four separate armies, under independent commanders:
that under McClellan in the Peninsula; that under
McDowell for the immediate protection of Washington; that
under Banks in the Shenandoah Valley, to prevent the Confederates
from crossing the Potomac; and that under Frémont in
the passes leading to West Virginia. By reason of the ease
with which the Confederates could move on interior lines from
one point to another, it was possible to strike either of the
Union armies with a large Confederate force before a Federal
combination could be formed. Hence, though the Confederates
were really much inferior in numbers, they were generally able,
in the battles that ensued, to attack with a superior force. The
Confederates had the further advantage of being in their own
country, where every movement of the Federals was easily
ascertained. In the early spring, the Union force numbered
about two hundred thousand, while the Confederates had
scarcely one hundred thousand; but the latter, by the conscription
act of April 15, increased their forces considerably.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s492'></a><span class='bold'>492. McClellan’s Peninsula Campaign.</span>—McClellan, with an
army one hundred thousand strong, reached the lower Peninsula,
between the York and the James, early in March. Here
he found himself confronted by General Joseph E. Johnston<a id='r218'/><a href='#f218' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[218]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
at Yorktown, and later at Williamsburg. Johnston’s force was
less than a third of McClellan’s, yet McClellan decided not to
attack, but to employ an engineer’s slow methods of siege. If
a resolute attack had been made, Johnston would probably
have been defeated, and
McClellan would have been
free to advance up the James.
Johnston watched his adversary
closely, well knowing
that when McClellan’s siege
works were ready they could
not be resisted. Meanwhile
the Confederate force was
constantly increasing, and
a precious month was gained
for drilling their new recruits.
On May 3, three days
before McClellan was to
attack, the Confederates
evacuated Yorktown. McClellan
ordered Hooker to
pursue. Overtaking Johnston at Williamsburg, Hooker was
repulsed, after which Johnston retreated rapidly towards Richmond.
McClellan followed with such slowness that fourteen
days were consumed in marching less than fifty miles. During
the whole of these two months, he enormously overestimated
the force by which he was confronted and continually asked
for reënforcements. On the 17th of May, Lincoln ordered
McDowell to join McClellan, but the order was not carried out,
for reasons that will now be given.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s493'></a><span class='bold'>493. Stonewall Jackson’s Movements.</span>—The slowness of McClellan’s
advance up the Peninsula not only relieved the
Confederate government of any fear for the safety of its capital,
Richmond, but also showed that General Thomas J. Jackson’s
corps could safely be spared for operations against the
Federals in the North. In order to defeat the larger forces
of McDowell, Banks, and Frémont, Jackson<a id='r219'/><a href='#f219' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[219]</span></sup></a> decided first to
strike the central army of the
Union troops, and then to destroy
the two wings in turn before they
could unite. Advancing with
Napoleonic rapidity from Staunton,
he fell upon Banks near
Winchester, Virginia, and not
only routed him, May 25, but
drove him across the Potomac
into Maryland. Then retracing
his steps, he turned his face westward,
and in a similar manner
overwhelmed the army of Frémont
at Cross Keys, June 8.
Meanwhile, General Shields of
McDowell’s army, who, with a
force about the size of Jackson’s, had crossed the Blue
Ridge in order to assist Frémont, found, on his arrival in
the Valley, that Frémont’s army had been broken up and
practically dispersed. Jackson had no difficulty in defeating
Shields, at Port Republic, as he had defeated the others.
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
Thus, in thirty-five days, Jackson’s army had marched two
hundred and forty-five miles, had fought three important
battles, besides two minor ones, winning them all, and had
practically destroyed three Union armies. He had also kept
forty thousand men under McDowell from joining McClellan.
Leaving a portion of his troops to keep up an appearance of
activity, he now turned swiftly to the south with the major
part of his force, and within a week was ready to coöperate
with Lee against McClellan. His movements had been so
rapid and mysterious that his departure was not detected at
Washington, and McDowell was needlessly kept in his place
for the defense of the capital.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s494'></a><span class='bold'>494. McClellan’s Slow Advance.</span>—While Jackson was causing
havoc near Washington, McClellan was slowly making his
way toward Richmond. On the 11th of May, he learned that
the Confederates had evacuated Norfolk and destroyed the
ironclad <span class='it'>Merrimac</span>, thus leaving the James open for the Federal
fleet. The <span class='it'>Monitor</span>, with its attending vessels, came up
the James River, and advanced as far as Drury’s Bluff, almost
within gunshot of Richmond. Had McClellan pushed rapidly
on, with the help of the fleet he could, in the opinion of many
military critics, have taken the city. Richmond was thrown
into consternation. But McClellan’s movements continued
to be so incredibly slow that all fear was soon dispelled. Instead
of keeping along the James, as he should have done as
soon as he learned of the movements of the <span class='it'>Monitor</span>, he
divided his army, putting part of his forces north of the
Chickahominy and part south of it. The bridges were greatly
weakened by floods, and the two divisions of the army, thus
separated, were in serious danger of not being able to coöperate
in case they should be attacked.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s495'></a><span class='bold'>495. Confederate Attacks.</span>—McClellan’s headquarters were
at Gaines’s Mill on the north side. Johnston, on May 31,
decided to attack the corps that confronted him at Fair Oaks,
or Seven Pines, on the south. The beginning of the battle was
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
favorable to the Confederates, and the Federals were saved
from complete rout only by the opportune arrival of Sumner’s
corps, which came over “swaying and tossing bridges” from
the north. But the serious wounding of Johnston and the
arrival of Sumner turned the tide, and at night the Unionists
had the advantage.<a id='r220'/><a href='#f220' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[220]</span></sup></a> Johnston, on account of his wound, was
obliged to retire from the command. In the morning, a new
bridge constructed in the night enabled reënforcements to be
transferred from the north side; but McClellan, who arrived on
the field only late in the day, instead of ordering an immediate
pursuit, expressed himself as satisfied and recalled his army
to the ground it had occupied before the battle. A Federal
corps at one time was within four miles of Richmond, and
it is probable that, if a prompt advance had taken place,
like that of Grant on the second day at Shiloh (§ <a href='#s478'>478</a>), the
city would have fallen, for the fortifications which later made
Richmond impregnable from this direction had not yet been
constructed.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General R. E. Lee.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s496'></a><span class='bold'>496. General Robert E. Lee.</span><a id='r221'/><a href='#f221' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[221]</span></sup></a>—General Lee, who up to this
time was Davis’s chief of staff, now succeeded Johnston as
general in command. He immediately gathered the reins into
his hands, and quickly showed that genius for organization
and action for which he soon became so celebrated. Directing
Longstreet to be prepared for an attack at any moment on his
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
right, he devoted the major part of his energies to the construction
of works which should make his lines impregnable.
Though McClellan’s
force was nearly twice
that of Lee, the industrious
Confederates
were not interfered
with. At length, near
the last of June, Lee
completed arrangements
for an offensive
movement. As Jackson
had now finished
his destructive work
in the vicinity of
Washington, Lee ordered
him to move
rapidly to the south,
so as to be ready for
an attack on McClellan’s
flank and rear.
The united forces of
Lee and Jackson,
amounting to fifty-five
thousand, were now
ready to fall upon the Federals north of the Chickahominy,
just as McClellan, with the larger part of his force, was preparing
to advance south of it.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s497'></a><span class='bold'>497. The First of the Seven Days’ Battles.</span>—The arrival of
Jackson was half a day later than had been expected, and consequently
the first Confederate attack was repulsed. But the
next day, June 27, with Lee in command, the Confederates,
fifty-five thousand strong, led by Jackson, Longstreet, D. H.
Hill, and A. P. Hill, at Gaines’s Mill assaulted the Federals,
thirty-one thousand strong, under the command of General
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
Fitz John Porter. A stubborn and magnificent resistance was
made, but it was only partially successful. Porter, however,
with the help of reënforcements from Sumner, was able to
withdraw in good order to the south side of the river. While
the battle on the north side of the Chickahominy was going on,
there were only about twenty-five thousand Confederates on
the south side, under Magruder, between Richmond and the
seventy thousand under McClellan. Again, however, no attempt
was made to take the capital.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s498'></a><span class='bold'>498. McClellan’s Change of Base.</span>—McClellan believed that
he was confronted by about one hundred and eighty thousand
men, and for safety determined to change his base of supplies
and transfer his army to the James River. In this move he
completely deceived Lee, and, after destroying a large part of
his stores, brought his army together in an orderly retreat.
The Confederates pursued, and severe battles took place at
Savage’s Station, Frayser’s Farm, and Glendale. The attacks
of the Confederates were, however, repulsed. Finally, Lee, in
opposition to the advice of his generals, determined on a desperate
assault upon Malvern Hill, where McClellan was very
strongly posted. The Confederates were defeated with great
slaughter, July 1.<a id='r222'/><a href='#f222' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[222]</span></sup></a> Then McClellan, who had won the majority
of the battles, but had lost the campaign, withdrew his
army to Harrison’s Landing on the James River.</p>

<h3 id='s499a'>PUBLIC FEELING IN THE NORTH AND GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s499'></a><span class='bold'>499. Influence of McClellan’s Defeat.</span>—McClellan’s defeat
greatly depressed the North and cheered the South; but Lincoln
showed his spirit by issuing a circular letter to the governors
of the loyal states, in which he declared that his purpose
was to fight the war through to the restoration of the Union,
and expressed the belief that the cause would best be promoted
if a call for new troops were first suggested by the governors.
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
The governors accordingly, on July 2, in a circular letter, asked
the President to call for “men enough to speedily crush the
rebellion.” Lincoln called for three hundred thousand volunteers,
and so hearty was the response, that the number furished
was over four hundred and twenty-one thousand.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s500'></a><span class='bold'>500. Attitude of Congress.</span>—Congress, also, showed that there
could be no thought of abandoning the contest, but, on the contrary,
promptly authorized the President to take possession of
all the railroads and telegraph lines whenever the public service
should seem to require it. Faith in the future was furthermore
proved by the enactment of many laws of a far-reaching
nature. Besides other important measures, Congress provided
for the construction of a railroad to the Pacific Ocean, established
the Department of Agriculture, and voted the “Morrill Grant,”
which gave to each state as many times thirty thousand acres
of land as it had members of Congress, for the support of
colleges in which agriculture and the mechanical arts should
be especially taught. The Morrill Act was the foundation
of most of the agricultural colleges and many of the state
universities in the country, and thus was of great educational
importance.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s501'></a><span class='bold'>501. The Question of Slavery.</span>—In the course of the summer
there was a general demand on the part of radical Republicans
that, either by act of Congress or by proclamation of the President,
slavery should be abolished. Lincoln held the opinion
that slavery could not be interfered with by Congress, but only
by an amendment of the Constitution or as a war measure by
the President, as commander in chief of the army. Frémont had,
as we have seen (§ <a href='#s470'>470</a>), declared the slaves free in Missouri,
and Hunter had done the same in South Carolina, Georgia, and
Florida; but the President had promptly annulled both these
orders, with the declaration that he could not allow any general
to free the slaves and throw the responsibility of the act upon
the President. Lincoln’s course provoked much opposition on
the part of radical opponents of slavery, and their dissatisfaction
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
was strongly expressed, August 20, in an editorial of Horace
Greeley’s in the <span class='it'>Tribune</span>, entitled “The Prayer of Twenty Millions.”
Lincoln’s clear and pungent answer<a id='r223'/><a href='#f223' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[223]</span></sup></a> served to satisfy
public opinion, but there is now evidence that he was thinking
seriously of the matter of emancipation. On the 13th of July,
he had said to Seward and Welles that “something must be done
in the line of a new policy,” that he had “about come to the
conclusion that it was a military necessity, absolutely essential
for the salvation of the nation, that we must free the slaves, or
be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ourselves subdued.” Following this line of thought, on
the 22d of August, he surprised all the members of his Cabinet,
excepting Seward and Welles, by presenting a proclamation
which he proposed to issue. The proposal met with general
favor, but Seward questioned the expediency of issuing it at
that juncture. In view of recent reverses, he thought it would
be regarded as “our last shriek on the retreat.” Seward’s
objection struck the President with force, and he put the
proclamation aside to await a victory.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s502'></a><span class='bold'>502. Dangers from Great Britain.</span>—The ill feeling of Great
Britain, which showed itself at the beginning of the war, and
was intensified by the <span class='it'>Trent</span> affair, in November, 1861, was
still further increased by the reverses of McClellan. It was
apparent that a majority of the British upper and middle
classes favored the South, that leading statesmen regarded the
defeat of the Union cause as inevitable, and that the most
delicate tact of diplomacy would be needed to prevent a formal
recognition of the Confederacy. In March, 1862, the <span class='it'>Florida</span>,
a vessel built and equipped for service with the Confederates,
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
sailed from Liverpool. Though seized at Nassau, she was
acquitted by what the British Chief Justice afterward called
“a miscarriage of justice,” and set free. In June attention
was called to a far more serious matter. The American
Minister at London, Charles Francis Adams, and Mr. Dudley,
the American Consul at Liverpool, became aware that another
war steamer, far more powerful than the <span class='it'>Florida</span>, was being
fitted out for the Confederate service. Adams at once called
the attention of Lord Russell, the British Minister for Foreign
Affairs, to the fact, and asked that the ship be detained, unless
it should be found, on investigation, that its purpose was not
hostile to the United States. The British government was
bound by international usage either to arrest the vessel or
make the investigation requested. They undertook the latter
course, but the process was so slow, and the work on the ship
was so rapid, that just before an arrest was to be made, the
vessel escaped and put to sea. This was the famous <span class='it'>Alabama</span>,
which, with the <span class='it'>Florida</span> and the <span class='it'>Georgia</span>, very nearly
cleared the ocean of American commerce.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s503'></a><span class='bold'>503. Pope and Halleck.</span>—Nearly a month before the end of
McClellan’s Peninsula campaign, the President summoned
General John Pope from the West, where he had been successful
as commander of the Army of the Mississippi. The
remnants of the forces of McDowell, Banks, and Frémont
were consolidated by Pope into a new organization, known
as the Army of Virginia, and pushed forward to the Rapidan
River. McClellan, on reaching Harrison’s Landing (§ <a href='#s498'>498</a>),
had written the President that his “army had been saved,”
but that it was completely exhausted, and needed a reënforcement
of one hundred thousand men. This surprising
statement, prompted by McClellan’s standing belief that Lee’s
forces greatly outnumbered the Federal army, induced Lincoln
to visit the camp at once. After a long conference with
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
McClellan, Lincoln decided, on July 11, to appoint Major General
Henry W. Halleck<a id='r224'/><a href='#f224' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[224]</span></sup></a> general in chief of all the armies of the
United States. Halleck
had commended
himself to the country
by successfully
directing affairs in
the West. Lee, anticipating
the course of
Halleck, whom he had
formerly known well,
immediately detached
Jackson from his
army before Richmond,
and sent him
to confront Pope.
Halleck visited McClellan
on July 24,
and, immediately afterward,
in order ultimately
to reënforce
Pope,<a id='r225'/><a href='#f225' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[225]</span></sup></a> ordered that
the Army of the
Potomac be withdrawn, and be transferred by way of Fortress
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
Monroe to the Potomac near Fredericksburg. The McClellan
campaign was thus admitted to have been a failure. Lee, now
freed from danger in the vicinity of Richmond, hastened to
reënforce Jackson by sending
to the Rapidan Longstreet’s
corps, which arrived on the
15th of August. A little
later, Lee followed and took
command of the entire force.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s504'></a><span class='bold'>504. The Second Battle of
Bull Run, or Manassas.</span>—In
the last week of August, Lee
sent Jackson and Longstreet
in succession around Pope’s
right flank, interposing their
forces between him and
Washington. Before any of
McClellan’s army, except Fitz
John Porter’s corps, had arrived,
the forces of Lee and
Pope fought the second battle
of Manassas, or Bull Run, on
the 29th and 30th of August. In view of the position of
the forces, it is not strange that the Union army, numbering
about sixty thousand men, was overwhelmingly defeated by the
Confederate force of about fifty thousand. The Union loss was
more than fourteen thousand, while that of the Confederates
was less than ten thousand. The issue of the battle was, at the
time, largely attributed to the delay of McClellan’s force in
returning from the James River, and especially to the failure
of General Fitz John Porter’s corps<a id='r226'/><a href='#f226' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[226]</span></sup></a> to render the proper assistance,
after it had arrived.
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s505'></a><span class='bold'>505. Battle of Antietam, or Sharpsburg.</span>—Lee, instead of
making a direct attack on Washington, decided to cross the
Potomac for an invasion of Maryland and the North. His
chief purpose, as he announced in a proclamation, was to arouse
the Confederate sentiment in Maryland and unite the state
with the Confederacy. Crossing the river near Harper’s Ferry,
he took Frederick City and pushed forward toward Pennsylvania.
But no signs of a sympathetic rising of the people
encouraged him. He was surprised to find that even farmers
whom he supposed to be Southern sympathizers would not
sell their produce for Confederate money. As soon as Lee
saw that he was not to get supplies in Maryland, he sent
Stonewall Jackson back to take Harper’s Ferry and thus
open communications for supplies with the rich Shenandoah
Valley. The heights above Harper’s Ferry had been neglected
by the Federals, and Jackson easily took the place, with twelve
thousand five hundred prisoners. McClellan, who on the 2d
of September, had arrived in Georgetown with the major part
of his army, after a long conference with the President in
Washington, was directed to resume command, not only of his
own forces, but also of the Army of Virginia. By spasmodic
promptness of movement, and encouraged by an accidental
discovery of Lee’s orders disclosing his whole plan of campaign,
the Union commander was able to advance so rapidly as to
throw his army in front of Lee. McClellan was jubilant, and
had confident hope of destroying or capturing Lee’s army.
But his later movements were so dilatory that Jackson returned
from Harper’s Ferry before the battle. The two armies first
came in contact in the vicinity of South Mountain. The preliminary
conflict was decidedly in McClellan’s favor. Then
occurred the desperate battle of Sharpsburg, or Antietam, on
the 17th of September. The Union army was the larger of the
two, but the number of the forces engaged cannot be confidently
estimated. The tactics of McClellan on the field have been
regarded by military critics as very faulty, while Lee is thought
to have handled his troops with great skill. It was the most
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
desperate and bloody single day’s battle of the war. The final
advantage was with the Federals, though the victory was not
by any means decisive. The losses of McClellan were more
than thirteen thousand, and Lee’s more than eleven thousand.<a id='r227'/><a href='#f227' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[227]</span></sup></a>
McClellan had lost another great opportunity; but Lee’s advance
was checked. He was so weakened that he was compelled
to withdraw to Virginia, and his movement as a whole
was a failure. At this time, when a rapid pursuit might have
broken up Lee’s army, which, according to Longstreet, was so
crippled that ten thousand fresh troops could have destroyed
it, McClellan had about twenty thousand troops in reserve. The
latter, mainly in consequence of his excessive caution and lack
of promptitude, was soon superseded by General A. E. Burnside.<a id='r228'/><a href='#f228' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[228]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s506'></a><span class='bold'>506. Burnside’s Disastrous Campaign.</span>—Burnside hastily
brought together all the Union forces in north Virginia for the
purpose of a direct advance on Richmond. With an army
which, early in December, numbered about one hundred and
thirteen thousand men, he crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg;
but Lee and Jackson had reached the southern
bank before him, and had posted their forces advantageously on
the high grounds back of the town. Burnside, having arranged
his army in three divisions, under Franklin, Hooker, and Sumner,
crossed the river on December 13, and had the temerity
to attempt to carry the works by storm. The result was
disastrous. The Union army was pushed back in confusion
upon the river, and might have been annihilated if Lee had
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
used his advantage. As it was, Burnside safely withdrew his
shattered forces to the north side of the river. The Union loss
was over twelve thousand,
while the Confederates
lost considerably
less than six thousand.<a id='r229'/><a href='#f229' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[229]</span></sup></a>
General Joseph E.
Hooker soon superseded
Burnside, and the Union
army went into winter
quarters. Lincoln was
especially depressed by
the result, as he had
hoped for a victory
which would counteract
the hostility of Great
Britain. The contrary
effect was indicated by
the <span class='it'>London Times</span>, which
referred to the battle as
“a memorable day to
the historian of the Decline
and Fall of the American Republic.” Throughout the
North, the following days were days of darkness and gloom.
Stocks declined, and troops volunteered more slowly than ever
before.</p>

<h3 id='s507a'>DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN EFFECTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS OF 1862.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s507'></a><span class='bold'>507. Military Results of the Year.</span>—Thus the events of the
year, notwithstanding great losses on both sides, had not essentially
changed the situation. While no territory of importance
had been lost, no considerable gain had been secured.
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>
McClellan, McDowell, Banks, Frémont, Pope, and Burnside
had all proved unable to cope successfully with their opponents,
and had all been relieved. Up to the end of 1862,
the military successes of the Union troops had all been in
the West and the great losses had all been in the East. The
military history of the year had made it evident to President
Lincoln and to Congress that every resource of the North
must at once be brought to bear upon the conflict in order
to insure success. The commander capable of holding his
own against Lee had not yet appeared. It was to require
another year to reveal him. Meanwhile, the necessities of
the situation led to the emancipation of the slaves, the levy
of new taxes, and the conscription of troops.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s508'></a><span class='bold'>508. Emancipation of Slaves.</span>—In March, 1862, slavery had
been abolished in the territories by Act of Congress, and in
April, emancipation had taken place in the District of Columbia.
In the same year, Lincoln had urged the governors of
the border states to adopt a proposition for compensation to
such of the border states as might abolish slavery. The
failure of the Peninsula campaign and the campaign in the
Shenandoah Valley, and the defeat at Manassas, convinced
the President that emancipation was justifiable as a war measure,
and should be resorted to as soon as a victory could be secured.
Accordingly, immediately after the battle of Antietam,
he issued a proclamation, declaring that in such slaveholding
states as should not have returned to their allegiance to the
United States on January 1, 1863, all slaves would, on that
day, be declared free. As none of the seceding states returned
to its allegiance, the Proclamation of Emancipation was issued
on the 1st of the following January, and thereafter, all
negroes in these states were regarded by the Union army as
free men.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s509'></a><span class='bold'>509. Influence of Emancipation on the War.</span>—The effect of
the Emancipation Proclamation was not quite what was anticipated.
Contrary to general expectation in the North, the
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
negroes showed remarkable faithfulness in remaining with
their old masters. They were very generally employed in the
South in caring for the plantations, and sometimes were used
for work on fortifications. It was only in recovered territory
that their relations were much changed. Before the end of
the war, about one hundred thousand of them were enlisted
in the Union army, and they fought with great bravery. As
the South refused to recognize them as soldiers, they could
not be exchanged when taken prisoners. The embarrassment
which followed had much to do with the entire cessation of
exchanges in the latter part of the war. In consequence of
this cessation, prisons were overcrowded and the sufferings
of prisoners increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s510'></a><span class='bold'>510. Effect of Emancipation upon Europe.</span>—In Great Britain,
public opinion was very slow to respond to the proclamation
of freedom. The fact that their supply of cotton was cut
off by the more complete blockade of the Southern ports
caused great suffering on the part of the British manufacturing
population. While the laboring classes were generally in
sympathy with the North, the owners of the factories and the
wealthy classes, led by Palmerston, the Prime Minister, and
Russell, the Foreign Secretary, were in favor of the South.
Many, not realizing that it was a war for national integrity,
regarded it as a war for liberty on the part of the South, and
for conquest on the part of the North.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s511'></a><span class='bold'>511. Change of British Policy.</span>—About the middle of October,
1862, the danger that Great Britain might recognize the
Southern Confederacy was averted. On the 7th of October, at
a banquet at Newcastle, Gladstone, then Chancellor of the
Exchequer declared, “Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the
South have made an army; they are making, it appears, a
navy; and they have made, which is more important than
either, a nation.” When the applause which followed this
utterance had subsided, he continued, “We may anticipate,
with certainty, the success of the Southern states so far as
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
their separation from the North is concerned.” This speech,
of which these sentences were the keynote, created a great
sensation, and was immediately interpreted as a purpose on
the part of the government to recognize the Confederacy.
The American Minister, seeing clearly that the drift was unmistakably
toward recognition, wrote to his government for
instructions in such a dire contingency. Then President Lincoln
sent a masterly letter which changed the whole situation.
His instructions to Mr. Adams in case the British Ministry
should approach him, directly or indirectly, on any matter of
our internal affairs, were as follows: “You will answer that
you are forbidden to debate, to hear, or in any way receive,
entertain, or transmit any communication of the kind. If the
British government, either alone, or in combination with any
other government, should acknowledge the insurgents, you
will immediately suspend the exercise of your functions, and
give notice of that suspension to Earl Russell, and to this
department.” The letter also contained these resolute words:
“We meet and confront the danger of a war with Great Britain.
We have approached the contemplation of that crisis with a
caution which great reluctance has inspired. But I trust that
you will also have perceived that the crisis has not appalled
us.” Adams hesitated to present this letter to Earl Russell,
but made its contents known to Russell’s friend, William E.
Forster, and gave his consent that Forster should in turn make
them known to Russell. It was probably at this juncture
that the Queen, if the “credible report” is true, said to
Russell, “My lord, no step must be taken which will involve
us in war with the United States.” On October 23, Russell
informed Adams that the policy of neutrality was not to be
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s512'></a><span class='bold'>512. Suspension of Habeas Corpus.</span>—In the summer of 1862,
the Northern opponents of the war took every advantage of
the military disasters to denounce the course of the government,
to discourage enlistments, to demand a cessation of hostilities,
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>
and, in many ingenious ways, to thwart the success of
the Union cause. After the disasters in the Peninsula and at
Manassas, the clamors were so great and the difficulties of conviction
for treason so many that, on the 24th of September,
President Lincoln issued an order suspending the writ of <span class='it'>habeas
corpus</span> throughout the country. This act was of doubtful constitutionality,
and shows, better than any other one thing, the
almost desperate straits into which the government was driven.
The suspension of the writ enabled the military authorities to
seize and imprison without trial any persons who might be
accused of treasonable acts, or even of disloyal speech. Large
numbers were arrested and thrown into prison.<a id='r230'/><a href='#f230' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[230]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s513'></a><span class='bold'>513. The Elections in 1862.</span>—The disasters in the field and
the suspension of the writ of <span class='it'>habeas corpus</span> had a marked
effect on the fall elections. In every one of the Northern
states the Republican majority was greatly reduced, and in
six of them<a id='r231'/><a href='#f231' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[231]</span></sup></a> that had cast their votes for Lincoln in 1860, the
Democrats were victorious. The House of Representatives
barely escaped being Democratic. It was almost a vote of
“want of confidence” in the President. An analysis of the
vote showed that many of the people regarded the Emancipation
Proclamation as a surrender of Lincoln to the radical
Republicans. It seems certain that more votes were lost than
gained in consequence of the Proclamation. But the President,
though disappointed, never for a moment swerved from
his purpose, as his message to Congress in December, 1862,
plainly showed.</p>

The impression made by newspaper correspondents on the country was
very unfavorable, and there was a loud and general demand for the removal
of Grant. The feeling took possession of a large majority of Congress and of
the President’s most ardent supporters. Delegates waited on Lincoln and
urged a change of commanders. Finally, A. K. McClure, a prominent editor
of Philadelphia, called on the President at eleven o’clock at night, and for two
hours urged Grant’s removal. After a long silence, Lincoln drew himself
up in his chair, and simply said, “I can’t spare this man, <span class='it'>he fights</span>.”</p>

“My paramount object in this struggle,” replied Lincoln, “is to save the
Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the
Union without freeing any slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by
freeing all its slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and
leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and
the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union, and what I
forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br/> <span class='bold'><span class='sc'>the campaigns of 1863.</span></span></h2>

<h3 id='s514a'><span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>VICKSBURG.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s514'></a><span class='bold'>514. Situation in the West.</span>—At the opening of the year
1863, it was evident that in the West the most important
military operations would center about Vicksburg, on the Mississippi
River, and Chattanooga, in eastern Tennessee. Vicksburg
was a strongly fortified city, and until it should be taken
the Mississippi River could not be controlled by the Union
forces. The importance of the place lay not only in the fact
that it prevented the Federals from making use of the river,
but also in the fact that it furnished the Confederates with
easy passage for troops and supplies from Texas and Mexico.
In strategic importance, it was scarcely inferior to Richmond
itself; for it now held the only remaining railroad which extended
from the far West into the Eastern states of the Confederacy.
Chattanooga was also important, since it was so
situated as to control, not only Eastern Tennessee, but also the
most easy and natural passage from Virginia to the Southwest.
Soon after Halleck was placed in command at Washington,
in July, 1862, Grant was left in charge of the territory about
Vicksburg, and Rosecrans about Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s515'></a><span class='bold'>515. First Efforts against Vicksburg.</span>—Vicksburg is situated
on a high bluff on the eastern side of the Mississippi. Just
above the town, the river turns sharply to the northeast, and
then, winding into a loop on which Vicksburg is built, flows
again toward the southwest. The regions west and south
being so low as often to be flooded, and the territory being
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
intersected by numerous streams, military movements were
rendered extremely difficult. In November and December,
1862, and again in January, 1863, unsuccessful attempts were
made against the city, by Grant and Sherman. As the spring
of 1863 advanced, efforts were renewed. Grant cut a new
channel for the river, across the neck, hoping to leave Vicksburg
high and dry inland. In this endeavor he was not successful.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s516'></a><span class='bold'>516. Johnston and Pemberton.</span>—The Confederate forces in the
West were commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who
had now recovered from his wound (§ <a href='#s495'>495</a>), General Pemberton
being second in command. Johnston desired to meet Grant
in the field, thinking that thus Vicksburg could best be held,
and ordered Pemberton to conduct operations on this line; but
Pemberton, encouraged by some recent successes, and not recognizing
Johnston’s right to command him, chose to fight behind
the fortifications of the city. This difference of policy divided
their forces, so that, while Pemberton remained at Vicksburg,
Johnston, with headquarters at Jackson, held himself in readiness
to attack the lines of Grant as opportunity might offer.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s517'></a><span class='bold'>517. Capture of Vicksburg.</span>—Grant’s next strategic move was
one of the most daringly planned and brilliantly executed of the
whole war. It was to pass with his army through the Louisiana
swamps west of the city, and, cutting himself free from
his base of supplies, to obtain a foothold on the river below,
while Admiral Porter should force a passage in the night
with his gunboats loaded with supplies. The movement, in
spite of determined resistance on the part of the Confederates,
was completely successful. After several minor engagements,
Grant took possession of the country as far as eighty miles
south and west of Vicksburg. Without waiting to establish
a base of supplies, and disregarding the earnest protest of
Sherman, he advanced, May 7, from Grand Gulf northeast
toward Jackson. Here, on May 14th, he defeated Johnston,
and later joined with Sherman on the east side of Vicksburg,
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
thus separating the Confederate armies. He then defeated
Pemberton in the open field, and finally, by May 18, drove
him behind his fortifications.<a id='r232'/><a href='#f232' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[232]</span></sup></a>
After weeks of
fruitless effort, Pemberton
was obliged, July 4,
to surrender with over
twenty-nine thousand
prisoners of war.<a id='r233'/><a href='#f233' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[233]</span></sup></a> This
was by far the greatest
Union victory yet
achieved, and the number
of prisoners was the largest
ever surrendered in
America. His success
made Grant the foremost
of the Federal generals.
Four days later, Port Hudson
also surrendered, and
the Mississippi River
throughout its course was opened to the Union army. The
Confederacy was thus cut into two parts, and no reënforcements
or supplies in any considerable amount could thereafter reach
the Southern armies from the west side of the river.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s518'></a><span class='bold'>518. Eastern Tennessee: Chickamauga.</span>—While Grant was
occupied about Vicksburg, important events were taking place
in the eastern part
of Tennessee. In
June, Rosecrans,
who had been
much criticised for
inactivity after the
battle of Stone
River, broke up his
encampment in the
vicinity of Murfreesborough.
Bragg was
a few miles to
the south, at Shelbyville,
but was
soon forced to fall
back on Chattanooga.
Rosecrans
then moved so far
around Bragg’s army
to the south that
the Confederate commander
deemed it prudent to evacuate Chattanooga and withdraw
some twelve miles into Georgia. Rosecrans hastened to
pursue; but Bragg, after receiving reënforcements under Longstreet
from Virginia, turned upon his pursuers. Rosecrans drew
back toward Chattanooga, and at Chickamauga was vigorously
attacked by Bragg. The battle raged furiously for two days,
September 19 and 20, and was one of the most sanguinary of
the war. The Union forces were finally driven from the field.<a id='r234'/><a href='#f234' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[234]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
General George H. Thomas,<a id='r235'/><a href='#f235' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[235]</span></sup></a> who, like Admiral Farragut, was a
Southern officer that took the Union side, greatly distinguished
himself by withstanding the final assaults on the center, and
so delayed the pursuit that the Union army was able to withdraw
in fair condition into Chattanooga. For this service,
Thomas was afterwards called “The Rock of Chickamauga.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s519'></a><span class='bold'>519. The Situation at Chattanooga.</span>—East of Chattanooga,
at a distance of about three miles, is situated a long, high hill,
rising almost to the magnitude of a mountain, known as Missionary
Ridge; while south of the city another elevation,
known as Lookout Mountain, rises about seventeen hundred
feet. On these two heights, overlooking Chattanooga, Bragg
established his army. He was also in control of the Tennessee
River. The force of Rosecrans, shut up in the city, had only
a single road, known by the soldiers as the “cracker trail,”
for supplies from the west. Every other approach was commanded
by the Confederate guns. Bragg was so sure that
the Union army would be forced to surrender, that he sent
Longstreet to assist in the siege of Knoxville, which city was
then held by General Burnside.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s520'></a><span class='bold'>520. Grant at Chattanooga.</span>—Soon after the battle of Chickamauga,
Rosecrans was relieved, and Grant, who had been
put at the head of all the armies west of the Alleghanies,
assumed command in his place. To reënforce the Union forces,
Hooker was sent with the Twelfth Corps from Virginia, and
Sherman, with the Army of the Tennessee, was brought from
Vicksburg by way of Memphis. Hooker took a position on
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>
the right, Sherman on the left, while Thomas, with the Army
of the Cumberland, commanded the center.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s521'></a><span class='bold'>521. Battles of Chattanooga.</span>—Grant’s plan, after opening a
line of supplies, was to have the two wings of the army push
back the opposing
flanks of the enemy
until the center would
be obliged to retire
from Missionary Ridge.
Bragg’s left, on Lookout
Mountain, was some
five miles in front of
his main line; and
Hooker’s army, in order
to dislodge the enemy,
was obliged to pass
over the shoulder of
the mountain. The
Twelfth Corps pushed
up the mountain side
with great gallantry,
fought what is sometimes
called “The Battle
above the Clouds,”
November 24, and soon
succeeded in driving the
enemy from the mountain and back beyond Missionary Ridge.
Sherman,<a id='r236'/><a href='#f236' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[236]</span></sup></a> on the left, advanced rapidly, but found a deep
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>
ravine in his way. Thomas was directed to engage the enemy
in front, in order to keep the Confederate center from attacking
Sherman, but not to advance to a general engagement. His
troops, however, not to be outdone either by the Army of
Virginia or by the Army of the Tennessee, charged up the
sides of Missionary Ridge and drove all before them. Bragg’s
forces, compelled to withdraw November 25, pushed rapidly
south through the field of Chickamauga and took up their
winter quarters at Dalton.<a id='r237'/><a href='#f237' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[237]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s522'></a><span class='bold'>522. Results of the Campaigns in the West.</span>—The battles
about Chattanooga closed the campaigns for the year. Kentucky
and Tennessee had been secured by the Union forces,
who, through the opening of the Mississippi River, were
enabled to pass freely to the Gulf of Mexico. The successes
of Grant at Vicksburg and Chattanooga raised him to such
importance that in November he was called to Washington,
and, in February, with the rank of lieutenant general, superseded
Halleck as general in chief of all the armies.</p>

<h3 id='s523a'>EASTERN CAMPAIGNS.</h3>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s523'></a><span class='bold'>523. Chancellorsville.</span>—In the East, at the close of the
Antietam campaign, McClellan, as we have seen, had been
superseded by Burnside, and the latter, after Fredericksburg,
by Hooker<a id='r238'/><a href='#f238' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[238]</span></sup></a> (§§ <a href='#s505'>505</a>-<a href='#s506'>506</a>). In April, 1863, the Union
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
army of about ninety thousand advanced southward for the
purpose of pushing its way by direct line to Richmond; but
a few miles south
of Fredericksburg,
Hooker was confronted
(at Chancellorsville)
by a Confederate
army of
about forty-five thousand
under Lee and
Jackson. The battle
which ensued, May
3, was most disastrous
to the Union
cause. By superior
generalship, Lee and
Jackson completely
thwarted the strategy
of Hooker, and
not only repulsed the
Federal army, but
threw it into confusion
and drove it
back to the north side of the Rappahannock. The Union loss
was about seventeen thousand; the Confederate, about twelve
thousand. The loss of the Confederates, however, was not
counted by numbers alone; for just before the main battle,
General “Stonewall” Jackson, the most successful corps commander
that the war produced on either side, was accidentally
fired upon and killed by his own men.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General George G. Meade.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s524'></a><span class='bold'>524. Second Advance into the North.</span>—Inspired by his remarkable
success at Chancellorsville, Lee decided to attempt again a
movement into the North. Crossing the Blue Ridge and marching
down the Shenandoah Valley, he passed the Potomac at
Harper’s Ferry, and, advancing across Maryland into Pennsylvania,
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
threatened, not only the rear of Washington, but also
the cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Hooker followed,
keeping at the right
of Lee, between Harper’s
Ferry and Washington,
and moving
rapidly northward for
the protection of the
threatened cities. The
Union army was reënforced
from every
quarter. On the 28th
of June, Hooker was
superseded by General
George G. Meade,<a id='r239'/><a href='#f239' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[239]</span></sup></a>
of Pennsylvania, a
soldierly officer who,
though uniformly successful
as a division
and corps commander,
had as yet
occupied only a
subordinate position.
Meade pushed his force of about ninety-three thousand rapidly
forward and concentrated it in the neighborhood of Gettysburg,
taking up his position on a crest of hills in a circular
line south and east of Gettysburg, on what is known as Cemetery
Ridge. The Confederate line of about seventy thousand
occupied the hills opposite, on Seminary Ridge.<a id='r240'/><a href='#f240' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[240]</span></sup></a> At the Union
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
right was Culp’s Hill, and at the left were two hills, known
as Round Top and Little Round Top. Thus situated, both
armies made ready for the most crucial battle of the war.
If Meade should be overwhelmed,
the cities of the
North would be at Lee’s
mercy, and the Confederacy
would, in all probability
be recognized in Europe;
while if Lee should be defeated,
he could hardly hope
to do more than prolong
an unsuccessful conflict.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s525'></a><span class='bold'>525. Battle of Gettysburg.</span>—During
the first and
second days’ engagements,
July 1 and 2, the Confederates
had the advantage.
Culp’s Hill was taken, and
the Union right was pushed
back from its strong defensive
line. On the left, however, the Unionists took and
held Little Round Top. On the other parts of the field the
repeated onsets of the Confederates were not successful.
Early on the morning of the third day, the Federals assaulted
Culp’s Hill, and, after most desperate fighting, succeeded
in retaking it. Lee then made the mistake of deciding
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
to stake everything on a mighty effort to break the Union
center. General George E. Pickett’s division of Longstreet’s
corps, consisting of about fifteen thousand veterans, was
ordered forward for a charge. After a tremendous fire of
one hundred and thirty cannon for two hours, for the purpose
of throwing the Union line into confusion, this division, made
up of the flower of the Confederate army, rushed forward to
the assault. For about one
mile they were within
range of the Federal guns.
No men ever fought more
bravely, but success was
impossible. The dead and
the dying strewed the
ground along the way.
Only a few of the fifteen
thousand reached the
Union line, and most of
these were obliged to give
themselves up as prisoners.
The effort failed, and
the battle was lost. Lee
magnanimously took the
whole blame of the defeat
upon himself, although he
might, seemingly, have thrown part of it on subordinates. The
Confederate loss was about twenty thousand, while that of
Meade was about twenty-three thousand.<a id='r243'/><a href='#f243' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[243]</span></sup></a> Lee conducted a most
skillful retreat, and was slowly followed by the tired Unionists
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
across Maryland into Virginia, until the two armies confronted
each other on the Rapidan, a branch of the Rappahannock. There
they remained more or less inactive until the following spring.</p>

<h3 id='s526a'>EMBARRASSMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s526'></a><span class='bold'>526. The Conscription of Troops in the North.</span>—As the war
dragged along, the novelty of it wore off, and enlistments in
the North began to flag. The discouraging outcome of the
Peninsula campaign and of the battles of Fredericksburg and
Chancellorsville caused a rapid decrease in the number of volunteers.
Draft, or conscription, was therefore resorted to by
Act of Congress, March 3, 1863. This Act of Conscription, however,
allowed exemption on payment of three hundred dollars,
an amount deemed sufficient for securing a substitute. As
only fifty thousand men were thus obtained, the three hundred
dollar clause was repealed, July 4, 1864, and a new act
declared that the conscript must serve or provide a substitute.
To furnish the means of avoiding such an alternative, insurance
companies were sometimes formed, and at times as much as
one thousand dollars was paid for a substitute. By this system
the service was much demoralized, for the large sums
offered attracted great numbers who had little or no interest in
the cause. Thousands of this class deserted, and to secure
bounty, reënlisted, in some instances many times over. Thus
“bounty jumper” became a term of deserved reproach. To
the first of the Conscription Acts there was much resistance,
especially in New York City. On July 13, 1863, a mob took
possession of the streets and had entire control of the city for
several days. The rioters burned about fifty buildings, and
hanged negroes to lamp-posts. The colored orphan asylum
was burned, and the inmates were with difficulty rescued from
the flames. It was not until troops sent from Gettysburg had
come to assist the police that order was restored. About twelve
hundred of the rioters were killed. Though conscription did
not of itself yield very many soldiers to the army, it greatly
stimulated volunteering.
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s527'></a><span class='bold'>527. Conscription in the South.</span>—As early as April, 1862,
all able-bodied white men in the South between the ages of
eighteen and forty-five were conscripted (§ <a href='#s454'>454</a>); and in
February, 1864, the age limit was extended, so as to include
all from seventeen to fifty. Thus, from almost the very
beginning of the war, not only agriculture, but all the other
industries of the South were thrown into the hands of men
beyond fifty, of women, of negroes, and of children. The
suffering that ensued may be imagined, but can hardly be
described.<a id='r244'/><a href='#f244' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[244]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s528'></a><span class='bold'>528. The Vallandigham Case.</span>—In 1863 there was not a
little excitement over the case of Clement L. Vallandigham, a
member of Congress from Ohio, who was the most extreme of
Northern sympathizers with the Confederacy. For utterances
disloyal to the government he was arrested by General Burnside,
and, after trial by a military commission, was imprisoned,
and, a little later, banished. He went first within the limits
of the Confederacy, and then to Canada. By the Democracy
of his state his arrest was regarded as arbitrary and his sentence
unlawful, and to show their displeasure, they nominated
him for governor. Though he was defeated by about one hundred
thousand majority, the size of the vote in his favor was
a significant indication of public feeling. The legality of his
arrest and banishment was tested by an appeal to the Supreme

enormous cost of the war required the new efforts for raising
money which have already been described (§§ <a href='#s456'>456</a>-<a href='#s458'>458</a>). In
the North industries flourished and the bills of the government
were promptly paid; but in the South a similar result
was impossible. The blockade prevented an income from
tariff and from the sale of cotton (§ <a href='#s455'>455</a>). The bonds payable
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
“six months after the ratification of peace with the United
States” sank in value as the success of the South became more
and more doubtful, until finally they almost ceased to have any
value whatever. A similar fate befell the Confederate bank
notes. As these notes were the only currency in circulation,
the prices of all articles rose enormously. In 1864 a pair of
shoes was worth one hundred and twenty-five dollars in Confederate
currency; a barrel of flour, two hundred and twenty-five
dollars; a pound of butter, fifteen dollars, and a bushel of
potatoes, twenty-five dollars. In one instance, thirty cords of
wood were sold for thirty teacupfuls of salt. Prices in general
were about fifty times as high as they had been when currency
was at par.</p>

Grant’s achievement is thus described by Rhodes: “In nineteen days
Grant had crossed the great river into the enemy’s territory; had marched
one hundred and eighty miles through a most difficult country, skirmishing
constantly; had fought and won five distinct battles, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had taken the
capital of the state and destroyed its arsenals and military manufactories,
and was now in the rear of Vicksburg.”—Rhodes, <span class='it'>History</span>, Vol. IV., p. 310.</p>

Grant’s forces at the beginning of the siege numbered about 43,000, but
they were so constantly reënforced that at the end he had not less than about
75,000. Official reports of the Confederate forces have not been preserved.
Johnston, June 4, estimated his force at 24,000 effective men. The lowest
estimate of Pemberton’s force is 28,000; the highest, 60,000. Grant’s aggregate
losses in the campaign were 9362. Confederate reports show a loss

<h3 id='s530a'><span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>GRANT AND LEE IN VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s530'></a><span class='bold'>530. Plan of Campaigns.</span>—The spring of 1864 found Grant
as general in chief of all the Union armies, with Meade at the
head of the Army of the Potomac, Sherman at the head of all
Federal troops in the West, and General B. F. Butler in immediate
command of the Army of the James. Grant chose not to
supersede Meade, but decided, while keeping him in the field,
to superintend the Eastern campaign in person. The “grand
strategy” was that all the Union armies should advance on the
4th of May, and that each should keep its opponents so occupied
that no one Confederate army could reënforce any of
the others. The Army of the Potomac was to move directly
toward Richmond, attacking the enemy wherever they could be
found. Sherman was to push south from Chattanooga with a
similar purpose, toward Atlanta, while Butler was to advance
up the James River from Fortress Monroe to Richmond. In
this way, it was hoped to finish the war in the course of the
summer.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s531'></a><span class='bold'>531. Advance of Grant toward Richmond.</span>—Grant, with a
force of about one hundred and twenty thousand men, crossed
the Rapidan and came upon Lee a little south of Chancellorsville.
The reports do not reveal exactly the size of Lee’s
army, but he probably had about sixty-five thousand men.
The Confederates were strongly intrenched, and a hotly contested
battle raged for two days, May 5 and 6. It is known as
“The Battle of the Wilderness,” since it was fought in a
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
country of tangled thickets. In some cases, so fierce was the
fighting, small trees were severed by bullets. Lee could not
be dislodged from his strong intrenchments, and Grant, after
enormous losses, moved with the bulk of his force by the left
flank, and thus forced the Confederates to leave their defenses
and fall back to a new line. From the 8th to the 20th various
desperate conflicts took
place about Spottsylvania,
with a similar
result. These battles
were among the most
stubbornly fought of
the whole war, the conflict
at what is known
as the “Bloody Angle”
being memorable as an
engagement at close
quarters, in which large
numbers were killed.
On the 21st, Grant,
undismayed by his failure
to break the Confederate
lines, again
moved by the left flank,
and Lee fell back still
nearer to Richmond,
intrenching himself
very strongly on the
North Anna River, and
later at Cold Harbor. Here, on June 3, Grant made a desperate
effort to crush the Confederates by assault, but Lee’s
lines could not be broken, and the attempt was as unsuccessful
as the Confederate assaults had been at Malvern Hill and at
Gettysburg. At Cold Harbor, the Federal loss was over ten
thousand, while that of the Confederates behind their intrenchments
was only about two thousand. The entire campaign is
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
rendered memorable by the unfailing skill of Lee’s resistance
and his remarkable foresight in divining the movements of his
enemy, as well as by the splendid energy of Grant’s attacks.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s532'></a><span class='bold'>532. Crossing the James.</span>—Skillfully concealing his main
movement by continuous attacks along the front, Grant then
accomplished the great feat of swinging his entire army across
the James, with the purpose of approaching Richmond from
the south. There, however, he was confronted with strong
fortifications about Petersburg, a city some twenty miles south
of Richmond, on the Appomattox River. During McClellan’s
campaign and since that time, so carefully had the entire country
been fortified under the direction of Lee that Grant found
an immediate advance impossible. The defenses in front of
Petersburg were at once mined by the Federal forces, and
on the 30th of July four tons of gunpowder were exploded
under the most powerful of the Confederate works. Guns and
men were thrown high into the air; but, by a gross blunder,
the troops who were to charge in through the breach were not
ready, and before the assault was made, the pit was protected
by Confederate cannon brought in from a distance on every
side. The Union forces lost many more by this effort, known
as the “Battle of the Crater,” than did the Confederates. The
best that Grant could do during the rest of the year was to
extend his lines to the south so far as to cut the railroad from
the southeast, which furnished the Confederates a large part of
their supplies, and to drill the new troops that came pouring in
from the seemingly inexhaustible North.<a id='r245'/><a href='#f245' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[245]</span></sup></a>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s533'></a><span class='bold'>533. Subordinate Movements.</span>—The subordinate movements
in the East had rendered Grant very little assistance. In the
spring General Butler<a id='r246'/><a href='#f246' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[246]</span></sup></a> had been sent up the James River,
with an army of thirty-six thousand men, to attack Richmond
from the south,
but the major part of
his troops were forced
by the Confederates
into a bend of the
river at Bermuda
Hundred, and there,
as Grant said, were
“bottled up.” Sigel
and Hunter also had
been sent into the
Shenandoah Valley for
the purpose of taking
Lynchburg and then
advancing on Richmond
from the southwest,
but they were
defeated by General
Early and driven over
the mountains into
West Virginia. Thus
the Confederates secured command of the entire Valley and
threatened Washington. Passing over into Maryland early in
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
July, they defeated General Lew Wallace at Monocacy, and
then pushed on until Early with his force actually appeared
before the defenses north of the capital. But finding these
more formidable than he had anticipated, he withdrew without
making an attack. Late in July, one of Early’s subordinates,
McCausland, burned Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in
consequence of a refusal of the city to pay a ransom of
five hundred thousand dollars in greenbacks. The vigor of
this policy provoked immediate retaliation. In September
Grant sent Sheridan against Early, and the tables were soon
turned. Early was defeated in several engagements in September
and October; and Sheridan, in accordance with Grant’s
orders, desolated the Valley of Virginia so completely that no
further supplies could be furnished the Confederate army before
another summer.</p>

<h3 id='s534a'>SHERMAN’S CAMPAIGNS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s534'></a><span class='bold'>534. Sherman’s Advance.</span>—In the West, the movement of
Sherman was in some respects similar to that of Grant. The
Union force gathered at Chattanooga numbered about one hundred
thousand men, while that of the Confederates numbered
about ninety thousand.<a id='r247'/><a href='#f247' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[247]</span></sup></a> Sherman’s policy was to attack Johnston’s
defenses lightly in front, and by extending his line either
to the right or to the left, attack the latter in the flank and oblige
him to come out into open battle or to retreat. Johnston, though
constantly fortified, instead of fighting vigorously, as Lee was
doing, fell back without offering great resistance. This course
was justified by the fact that Johnston knew that Sherman’s
army must be fed by transportation over a single line of railroad,
and by the belief that if Sherman could be drawn into the
South, so much of the Union army would be required for guarding
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
trains, and such reënforcements might be secured by the
Confederates as they neared Atlanta, that the two armies might
ultimately meet on equal terms. In other words, it seemed
obvious to the Confederate commander that the farther south
Sherman should be drawn, the weaker he would be. The mistake
in this strategy lay in underestimating the resources of the
North in furnishing new troops with which to aid in protecting
the railroad and keeping up the numbers of the Union force.<a id='r248'/><a href='#f248' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[248]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s535'></a><span class='bold'>535. Removal of Johnston.</span>—The campaign was in a mountainous
country just south of Chattanooga, and great skill was
shown by both generals. Johnston was rapidly pushed back
until his forces were near Atlanta, and a decisive battle was at
hand. But the people of the South, not understanding the
merits of Johnston’s method of conducting the campaign,
became impatient. President Davis,<a id='r249'/><a href='#f249' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[249]</span></sup></a> who had no partiality
for Johnston, yielded to the pressure of public opinion, and,
accordingly, just as the Confederates were about to strike their
blow, Johnston was removed, and General John B. Hood,<a id='r250'/><a href='#f250' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[250]</span></sup></a>
who had the reputation of being one of the most energetic
generals in the Confederate army, was placed in command.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/p428.jpg' alt='' id='p428' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General J. B. Hood.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s536'></a><span class='bold'>536. General Hood’s Methods.</span>—Hood’s fighting qualities,
however, in accordance with Sherman’s predictions, at once
took the form of rashness. He seemed determined to fight,
whether a favorable opportunity offered or not. In three
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
important battles in July, on different sides of Atlanta,<a id='r251'/><a href='#f251' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[251]</span></sup></a> Hood
made desperate attempts to beat back the approaching forces,
but was unsuccessful. On September 2 he was obliged to evacuate
the city, and early in October he adopted the policy of moving
around Sherman’s army and attacking the line of supplies.
This was done in the hope that Sherman would follow; but the
move was exactly what Sherman anticipated and desired. Following
for a short distance,
he sent on half of his army
under General Thomas, while
he returned with the other
half to Atlanta. Hood
pushed on vigorously toward
Nashville. At Franklin,
south of Nashville, a battle
was fought, November 30,
between Hood and a part
of Thomas’s army under
Schofield, in which the
Confederates lost heavily.<a id='r252'/><a href='#f252' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[252]</span></sup></a>
Thomas made his stand at
Nashville and fortified his
line with great skill. Remaining
long wholly on the
defensive, he was much
criticised for his delay in
attacking; but his answer was that, while willing to turn
over his command to another, he would not go out of his
defenses to fight a decisive battle until he was ready. The
outcome justified his course. On the 15th of December Hood
advanced to the attack, and the battle raged for two days; but
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
when the Confederates had spent their force, Thomas ordered
his men forward and pushed on so vigorously that Hood’s army
was completely broken up and dispersed.<a id='r253'/><a href='#f253' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[253]</span></sup></a> It was the most
decisive Union victory of the war. Thus Hood, after losing
five battles, had now lost his army.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s537'></a><span class='bold'>537. Sherman’s March to the Sea.</span>—As soon as Hood was
clearly out of his way, Sherman began preparations for carrying
out a plan which had for some time been maturing in his
mind. In the spring a movement from Atlanta to Mobile had
been contemplated; but Banks had failed to advance upon
Mobile from the west, and the plan had been abandoned. Sherman
now obtained the consent of Grant to destroy the public
works at Atlanta, to break up the railroads so as to cut off Lee’s
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>
sources of supply, and then to take his army across Georgia
to the sea. This project was undertaken for the purpose of
closing in upon Lee from the south and in this manner
bringing the war to an end. About the middle of November,
Sherman, having burned such parts of Atlanta as might be useful
to the enemy, cut all the telegraph wires extending to the
north, tore up the railroads in every direction, and then with
his army started for the sea. He had about sixty thousand
men. These were divided into four divisions and were spread
out so that they covered a territory about sixty miles in width.
To make repair as difficult as possible, the railroads were
destroyed by heating and twisting the rails, and the stations
and bridges were burned.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s538'></a><span class='bold'>538. Capture of Savannah.</span>—The army reached the sea,
December 13, after a march of nearly four weeks. During
all this time the people of the North were ignorant of what
Sherman was doing. Fort McAllister, at the mouth of the
Ogeechee River, was stormed by Hazen’s division of the Fifteenth
Corps, and in a single assault of a few minutes was
taken. Savannah was besieged, and after eight days the city
surrendered, December 21, with a hundred and fifty guns and
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton. The army then went into
winter quarters, where it remained until February, 1865. Thus
Sherman had destroyed the most important Confederate army
in the West, had everywhere dispersed opposing troops, and
had made transportation of supplies for Lee from the south
and west so difficult as to be practically impossible.</p>

<h3 id='s539a'>NAVAL VICTORIES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s539'></a><span class='bold'>539. Work along the Coast: Fort Fisher.</span>—In the course of
the year 1864, much was done along the coast to lessen the
number of ports held by the Confederates. The most important
of the expeditions were those against Fort Fisher in North
Carolina, and Mobile in Alabama. Fort Fisher, which commanded
the entrance to Wilmington Bay, had successfully
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>
resisted an attack by General Butler and Admiral Porter, but
now yielded to a force under General Terry, sent by Grant.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s540'></a><span class='bold'>540. The Taking of Mobile.</span>—Even more important was the
taking of Mobile. The mouth of the harbor was defended by
Fort Gaines and Fort Morgan, and the passage to the city was
protected by torpedoes and mines. Within the harbor were
four powerful Confederate gunboats, including the <span class='it'>Tennessee</span>,
commanded by Commodore Buchanan, the former captain of
the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span>. Outside, Admiral Farragut had a fleet of fourteen
wooden vessels and four monitors. On the 5th of August
Farragut determined to hazard a desperate attempt to run past
the forts. The task was not less difficult than the one which
had confronted him at New Orleans. In order to have a better
means of observing and directing the battle, he had himself
lashed to the topmast of the flagship <span class='it'>Hartford</span>. The battle
that followed was desperate and brilliant. One of Farragut’s
vessels was blown up and sunk by a torpedo, but the admiral
pushed on past the forts and engaged the <span class='it'>Tennessee</span>, which
was obliged to surrender. The capitulation of the forts soon
followed. After the fall of Wilmington and Mobile, the only
port still held by the Confederates was Charleston. Importation
of supplies by the Confederates was therefore rendered
almost impossible, and many of the Federal vessels engaged
in preventing blockade running were released for other services.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s541'></a><span class='bold'>541. Defeat of the Alabama: Loss of the Florida and Georgia.</span>—In
the course of the same year, the most powerful of the Confederate
privateers was destroyed. The <span class='it'>Alabama</span>, which under
Captain Raphael S. Semmes had taken many Union vessels in
all parts of the world, was followed by the <span class='it'>Kearsarge</span>, under
Captain Winslow, into the harbor of Cherbourg, in the north
of France. The ships were about equal in weight and strength.
Semmes dared Winslow to a naval duel and his challenge
was instantly accepted. The fight occurred on June 19, 1864,
and was witnessed by thousands of people on the banks. The
firing of the <span class='it'>Alabama</span> was much more rapid than that of the
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
<span class='it'>Kearsarge</span>, but much less accurate. Within about an hour after
the engagement began, the <span class='it'>Alabama</span> was found to be in a
sinking condition. She struck her flag and soon afterward sank.
Captain Semmes was taken from the water by an English yacht
and carried to England. Another famous Confederate cruiser,
the <span class='it'>Florida</span>, was accidentally sunk near Fortress Monroe; and
the <span class='it'>Georgia</span> was sold and became a merchant vessel under the
English flag. All this, however, did not occur until the commerce
of the United States had been practically destroyed.</p>

<h3 id='s542a'>POLITICAL AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s542'></a><span class='bold'>542. Opposition to Lincoln’s Policy.</span>—The suspension of <span class='it'>habeas
corpus</span> in 1863, and the arrest of Vallandigham and many
others, excited great feeling among the opponents of President
Lincoln (§§ <a href='#s512'>512</a>, <a href='#s528'>528</a>). He was boldly accused of exceeding his
constitutional rights, and many newspapers carried on a vigorous
battle against him. The history of public sentiment was
still more striking in 1864. Early in the year many of the
leading Republicans, especially those of the more radical type,
thought it would not do to renominate Lincoln. There was a
widespread outcry for peace, and the impression became general
that peace would be possible if the government would
abandon its policy of emancipation. Grant’s Virginia campaign
had resulted in great slaughter and had brought sorrow into
thousands of households, without bringing him any nearer to
Richmond than McClellan had been two years before. Greeley
and other prominent Republicans desired a change of policy;
but notwithstanding all warnings, Lincoln kept steadily on his
course, although at one time he recognized the probability of
his defeat for the Presidency.<a id='r254'/><a href='#f254' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[254]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s543'></a><span class='bold'>543. Effects of Victory.</span>—But these dark hours were soon
followed by light. First came Farragut’s exploit in taking
Mobile; and then, on the 3d of September, followed the stirring
news that Sherman had taken Atlanta. The effect
was like magic. Seward, in a speech, September 14, said,
“Farragut and Sherman have knocked the bottom out of the
Chicago [Democratic] nominations.” Then, as a crowning and
thrilling inspiration, came the descriptions of Sheridan’s ride
(§ <a href='#s533'>533</a>) and the complete routing of Early at Fisher’s Hill. A
veritable wave of enthusiasm took possession of the North.
Lincoln was unanimously renominated, with Andrew Johnson
of Tennessee for Vice President; and the election gave them
two hundred and twelve votes, as against twenty-one given
McClellan, the Democratic candidate.<a id='r255'/><a href='#f255' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[255]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s544'></a><span class='bold'>544. Results of the Election.</span>—The result of this election
and the Federal victories put new vigor into the Union cause.
Recruiting went on rapidly, so that the government in the
spring of 1865 had more than a million men under arms. The
Confederacy had no such reserve power. It had now lost much
more than half of its territory; its sources of supplies were cut
off, and its armies were confronted from the south, as well as
from the north, by overwhelming forces.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s545'></a><span class='bold'>545. Changes in the Cabinet.</span>—Lincoln’s first Cabinet contained
not only his rivals for the Republican nomination in
1860, but also a number of representative “War Democrats.”
When Stanton, who had always been a Democrat, took the
place of Cameron (§ <a href='#s475'>475</a>), it was noticed that the Cabinet
contained four Democrats and only three Republicans. When
reminded of this fact, Lincoln intimated that he counted for
something himself, and could perhaps manage to prevent the
administration from becoming Democratic. As time went on,
there were many complaints in regard to the supposed lack
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
of harmony in the Cabinet; and the Presidential nominating
convention of 1864 requested the President to make the body
more homogeneous. This resolution was aimed especially at
Montgomery Blair of Maryland, who was Postmaster-General,
and Edward Bates of Missouri, the Attorney-General. They
soon resigned and were succeeded respectively by William
Dennison of Ohio, who had been president of the nominating
convention, and James Speed, a prominent lawyer from
Kentucky. Salmon P. Chase, who had often been much out
of harmony with the President, resigned the Secretaryship of
the Treasury, and was succeeded by William P. Fessenden of
Maine. When Chief Justice Taney, after long and important
service, died, on the 12th of October, there was much anxiety
in regard to the appointment to the position thus made vacant—the
most important in the gift of the President. Among
others, Chase was a very prominent candidate, strongly urged
by radical Republicans. The President gave no sign of his
intentions until December 6, when, without having consulted
any one, he sent to the Senate, in his own handwriting, the
nomination of Chase to be Chief Justice. The nomination was
immediately confirmed without reference to a committee.
The changes in the Cabinet and the appointment of Chase
gave great satisfaction.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s546'></a><span class='bold'>546. The Thirteenth Amendment.</span>—The last important work
of Congress in 1864 was the passage of a joint resolution to
submit to the states the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution,
which should forever prohibit slavery throughout the
United States. The Proclamation of Emancipation afforded
no certainty that after the seceding states had been brought
back into the Union, they might not legally reëstablish
slavery. This could be prevented only by a Constitutional
Amendment. Such an Amendment had been offered in April,
and had passed the Senate, but had failed in the House to
secure the required two-thirds vote. Now, however, it was
recalled, and after a long and memorable debate was duly passed
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>
in the required manner (January 31, 1865), amid great enthusiasm
on the part of Representatives and auditors. The Amendment,
however, before it could be operative, had to receive the
approval of three-fourths of the states. The President saw
that it would probably fail by one vote, and, in order to secure
that vote, he procured the admission of the territory of Nevada
as a state.<a id='r256'/><a href='#f256' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[256]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s547'></a><span class='bold'>547. Efforts to Secure Peace by Negotiation.</span>—Throughout
the year 1864 there had been attempts in the North, as well
as in the South, to bring about negotiations for peace. These
attempts culminated in February, 1865, when President Lincoln
and Secretary Seward met Alexander H. Stephens<a id='r257'/><a href='#f257' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[257]</span></sup></a> and two
companions, on a steamer in Hampton Roads, for an amicable
discussion of the situation. Lincoln refused to negotiate except
on the basis of a disbanding of the Confederate forces and
a restoration of the national authority. Stephens attempted
to convince Lincoln that he would be justified in treating with
“rebels,” and referred to the case of Charles I. in England.
Lincoln replied that he was not strong in history but relied
upon Seward for all such knowledge; what he specially remembered
of that contest was that “Charles I. lost his head.”
The negotiations came to nothing.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s548'></a><span class='bold'>548. Sherman’s Advance.</span>—There was enough activity of the
Federal troops in the Southwest during the early spring of
1865 to prevent any important movements of the Confederates
to reënforce Lee, and accordingly interest was concentrated in
the campaigns of Sherman and Grant. Sherman broke camp
in Savannah, February 1, and at once moved northward. In
the course of his march, Sherman passed through Columbia,
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
South Carolina, and while the army was there the city was
burned. Each side has accused the other of the act; but the
facts have never been determined beyond dispute.<a id='r258'/><a href='#f258' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[258]</span></sup></a> In order
to strengthen the army under Johnston, whom Davis had felt
obliged to reinstate, the Confederates evacuated Charleston, thus
giving their last port into the hands of the Federals. Johnston
had collected about thirty thousand men, but he did not venture
an engagement until Sherman had advanced nearly as far north
as Goldsboro. The winter rains had not subsided, and Sherman’s
forces encountered very great difficulties. Near Goldsboro,
March 16, and again March 19, Johnston attacked with
vigor, but the Confederates were driven back, and Sherman
entered the town, March 23. Here he received reënforcements
from Wilmington. Johnston was now in no condition to meet
the augmented Union army, and Sherman seems to have wished
not to push his advantage until he knew the results of the movements
about Richmond.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s549'></a><span class='bold'>549. Cavalry Movements of Wilson and Stoneman.</span>—While
Sherman was advancing in North Carolina, two cavalry expeditions
were ordered by Grant to set out from Thomas’s army in
Nashville,—one for Alabama, under General J. H. Wilson, and
one under General Stoneman for East Tennessee and Virginia.
The purpose of these expeditions was not only to clear the
regions visited of Confederate stores and troops, but also to
prevent Lee and Davis from escaping toward the west or
south. Stoneman, having rapidly completed his work in East
Tennessee, destroyed the important depot of Confederate supplies
at Lynchburg, late in March, and on the 9th of April
captured and destroyed the large military magazines at Salisbury,
North Carolina. Wilson devastated much of Alabama;
and on the 2d of April met and dispersed Forrest’s last available
force near Selma, where he completely destroyed a great
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
arsenal of arms and stores. The dwindling Confederate force
in Richmond was now confronted in four directions.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s550'></a><span class='bold'>550. Grant’s Advance.</span>—Grant began his campaign by a
further movement south of Petersburg, January 31, when he
took possession of
Hatcher’s Run. While
attracting the attention
of Lee at this
point, he sent Sheridan,<a id='r259'/><a href='#f259' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[259]</span></sup></a>
with an army of
ten thousand picked
cavalry, up the Shenandoah
Valley, for the
purpose of cutting the
Lynchburg and Richmond
railroad, by
which Lee was receiving
the larger part of
his supplies. Sheridan
scattered the
forces of Early and
was completely successful.
Returning by
way of Charlottesville,
Sheridan rejoined Grant, March 29, and was at once put
in command of the extreme left of the Union army, with orders
to push on around the Confederate left, to Five Forks. This
movement obliged Lee to extend his line to that point, but,
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
as he now had only about fifty thousand men with whom to
contend against the one hundred and twenty thousand commanded
by Grant, it was impossible to protect Richmond in
the north and to guard his communications at the south. The
Confederate lines were so long that Lee hardly had one thousand
men to a mile. He therefore, after his lines had been
broken at Five Forks, April 1, decided to abandon the city.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s551'></a><span class='bold'>551. Surrenders of Lee and Johnston.</span>—With the attack of
Sheridan on the extreme left, Grant ordered an assault, April 2,
all along the line. Lee
found that the only
way to save his army
was not only to abandon
Richmond, but to
withdraw rapidly to the
west. He had wished
to abandon the capital
before, but had deferred
to the wishes of Davis.
On the morning of
April 3, the Union
troops entered Richmond without opposition. Lee and his
army turned westward, but
the advance of Sheridan
was so rapid that escape
was impossible. Great
blunders were committed
by the Confederate commissariat,
and Lee’s forces
were almost without food.
At Appomattox Courthouse,
further retreat was
cut off, and on the 9th
of April Lee surrendered
his army to Grant at an
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
interview between the two commanders which brought out
the best qualities of each. Lee’s troops were required only
to bear no more arms against the United States; and they were
allowed to retain their horses for spring plowing. Never before
at the end of a great war had such magnanimous terms been
given. On the retreat from Richmond, many men had thrown
away their arms and taken to the woods, so that the number
finally surrendered was only twenty-eight thousand, three
hundred and fifty-six. After a sharp dispute between Sherman
and Stanton, as to the conditions that should be granted,
Johnston capitulated to Sherman, on similar terms, April 26.
All the other Confederate armies surrendered before the end
of May.</p>

<h3 id='s552a'>THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>House at Appomattox in which Lee<br/> and Grant arranged the Surrender.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s552'></a><span class='bold'>552. Assassination of Lincoln.</span>—While the people of the
North were everywhere rejoicing over the termination of
the war, they were suddenly cast into the deepest grief by
an event of the utmost horror. A conspiracy to assassinate
the President was successful. On the evening of April 14,
President Lincoln was sitting in a private box at one end of
the stage in Ford’s theater. Between two of the acts, John
Wilkes Booth, an actor, stole into the box and, from the rear,
shot the President through the head. Then leaping out from
the front of the box upon the stage in full view of the audience,
he shouted, “<span class='it'>Sic semper tyrannis</span>” (“Ever thus to tyrants,”—the
motto of Virginia), and passing through a rear door of the
stage, escaped. In the midst of the excitement that ensued, the
President was tenderly carried to a neighboring house, where
he received every possible surgical aid, but no effort could save
his life. He expired the next morning. Booth in his leap to
the stage injured one of his legs, but he succeeded in mounting
a horse that was in waiting, and crossed one of the bridges into
Virginia. For several days he evaded his pursuers; but the
whole region was in arms, and he was finally brought to bay.
Refusing to give himself up, he was shot by a Union soldier.
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span>
On the evening that Lincoln was shot, one of the other conspirators
entered the house of Secretary Seward and attacked
him in bed with a huge bowie-knife. Though desperately
wounded, Seward finally recovered. Of the conspirators arrested,
four were hanged and four imprisoned. It is still a
question whether, in the prevalent excitement, injustice was
not done in some of these executions.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s553'></a><span class='bold'>553. Funeral of Lincoln.</span>—The grief of the people was unprecedented.
The greatness of Lincoln’s life and the pathos
of his death touched every heart. His body was taken for
interment to Springfield, Illinois; and so universal was the
love and sorrow, that the people insisted upon making the
movement a national event. At New York and other important
points along the route, his body lay in state and was
viewed by millions of people. Three weeks were required for
the funeral train to reach Springfield.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s554'></a><span class='bold'>554. Lincoln’s Policy toward the South.</span>—The people of the
South showed something of the grief of the North, for many
had already begun to see that in war Lincoln had not been a
harsh enemy, and that in peace he was likely to be a real friend.
They very naturally felt that the murder of the President would
probably make the people of the North harsher toward the
South, now that the victory had been secured. They did not at
that time know what has since been revealed of Lincoln’s generous
feeling toward them. At a Cabinet meeting on the very day
of his assassination he had discussed the reconstruction of the
South. “Enough lives have been sacrificed,” he said; “we
must extinguish our resentment, if we expect harmony and
union.”</p>

<h3 id='s555a'>THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s555'></a><span class='bold'>555. The Army and the Navy.</span>—The Union army had grown
steadily in numbers, until at the close of the war the lists showed
an enrollment of 1,000,516 men, of whom more than six hundred
thousand were fit for active service.<a id='r260'/><a href='#f260' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[260]</span></sup></a> The Union navy had
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>
grown until it consisted of about seven hundred vessels, of
which sixty were ironclads. It was at that time the most
powerful navy in the world.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s556'></a><span class='bold'>556. Extent of the Losses.</span>—The Union forces had 44,236
killed in battle, while 49,205 died from wounds. Those who
died of disease numbered 186,216. In prison and from accidents
and unknown causes, the deaths were 50,352, making a
sum total of 330,009. There were buried in the national
cemeteries the bodies of 318,870, but a considerable number
of these were Confederate soldiers. The number of deaths in
the Confederate service was less, but figures have not been so
carefully preserved, and the exact truth can, probably, never
be known. The number of actions in the course of the war of
sufficient importance to receive names was no less than twenty-four
hundred.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s557'></a><span class='bold'>557. The Cost of the War.</span>—The cost of the war was enormous;
but it cannot be accurately told. In addition to about
$780,000,000 that had been paid by taxation, while the contest
was going on, the national debt had, from $65,000,000, in June,
1861, grown in 1865 to be $2,850,000,000. If to this vast sum
we add the debts of states and cities, and the pensions that
were paid before 1900, the total cost of the war to the country,
exclusive of expenditures by the Confederates, can hardly have
been less than ten billions of dollars.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s558'></a><span class='bold'>558. Suffering.</span>—In the South the suffering in consequence
of the war was vastly greater than in the North. The freeing
of four million slaves completely changed the organization of
society. Wherever the Northern armies had gone, there had
been great destruction of property and thousands of homes
had been ruined. Throughout the later years of the war there
had been much suffering of individual families, and the sources
of income of many that had previously known independence or
affluence, had been entirely taken away. When emancipation
took place, the suffering was somewhat increased, although,
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>
as a rule, the negroes showed remarkable fidelity to their
owners.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s559'></a><span class='bold'>559. Final Review.</span>—On the 23d and 24th of May such
parts of the Armies of the East and of the West as were within
reach, had the privilege of passing in review before their
commanders and the representatives of the nation. For two
whole days the armies filled the long stretch of Pennsylvania
Avenue from the Capitol to Georgetown, and, in a compact
mass, from curbstone to curbstone, passed in front of the
reviewing stand at the White House. The spectacle was the
mightiest the continent had ever seen; but it was much more
than a spectacle. It was a vast army of citizens peaceably
going home after the most bloody and terrible of modern wars.
Of the more than a million Union soldiers under arms in the
spring of 1865, before the next winter all but about fifty thousand
had been quietly mustered out and become, in the main,
orderly and industrious citizens.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s560'></a><span class='bold'>560. The Military Lessons of the War.</span>—As time has passed,
students have learned that the military lessons taught by
the war were numerous and important. Four of them are
especially worthy of note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The battle between the <span class='it'>Monitor</span> and the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> convinced
every one that wooden vessels could no longer be of
any service against ships of iron. In less than a generation,
every navy of importance in the world was made up exclusively
of iron ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) The habit of instantly throwing up protecting intrenchments,
whenever either army came to a halt near the other,
completely revolutionized military field practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) More important still was the lesson that military training
of officers cannot be dispensed with in any nation. The successful
commanders of the war in the North, as well as in the South,
were, almost without exception, officers who had been trained
in the military schools. In the early part of the contest, especially
in the North, men with political influence were often
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
put into responsible positions; but such appointments generally
proved disastrous, and the authorities had to fill their
places with men who had received a careful military training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) But the greatest lesson of all was taught by the rapidity
with which a great army could be put into the field in an emergency,
and then quietly disbanded. Stanton, in his report as
Secretary of War in 1865, called attention to several remarkable
facts in this connection. After the disaster in the Peninsula
more than eighty thousand troops were enlisted, organized,
equipped, and sent into the field in less than thirty days. Sixty
thousand new troops repeatedly went into the field within four
weeks; and from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin
ninety thousand men were raised and sent into the armies within
twenty days.<a id='r261'/><a href='#f261' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[261]</span></sup></a> These facts showed that a large standing army
is unnecessary in a self-governing nation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s561'></a><span class='bold'>561. The French in Mexico.</span>—The immense military power
and prestige of the United States were soon illustrated in a
striking manner. Throughout the war the imperial government
of France, under Napoleon III., was in active sympathy
with the effort to destroy the Union. When Napoleon III.
found that Great Britain would not, as he desired, acknowledge
the independence of the Confederacy, he turned his
attention in another direction, and stirred up a revolution in
Mexico, which overthrew the Republican form of government
and established an empire under Maximilian, an Archduke of
Austria. While the United States government was at war, it
was in no condition to do more than to issue a formal protest;
but when the war was over, and there were a million men
available, France perceived the advisability of withdrawing
her troops from Mexico at the suggestion of the United States.
With a courage worthy of a better cause, Maximilian refused
to withdraw with them. The Mexicans soon revolted, and in
1867, the emperor was taken prisoner and shot. The United
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
States government entreated for his life, but the request was
formally refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s562'></a><span class='bold'>562. President Johnson.</span>—Andrew Johnson,<a id='r262'/><a href='#f262' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[262]</span></sup></a> a Democrat
from Tennessee, was the only Southern senator who refused to
resign his place when, in 1861, the other senators withdrew
from Congress. Partly because he was such a stanch Unionist,
and partly because the Republicans desired to develop a Union
sentiment in the South, he was elected as Vice President on
the ticket with Lincoln, in 1864, and in consequence became
President on the death of the latter.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s563'></a><span class='bold'>563. Lincoln’s Reconstruction Policy.</span>—Lincoln, with his customary
foresight, some time before the end of the war, had set
forth his ideas on the policy of the reconstruction of the seceded
states. He expressed the opinion, in an address, that the question
whether the “seceded states,” so-called, were in the Union or
out of it, was “a mere pernicious abstraction”; that “they were
out of their proper practical relation with the Union,” and that
“the sole object of those in authority should be again to get them
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>
into that proper practical relation.” With the exception of
certain classes, he had previously by proclamation offered
pardon to all persons who should take the oath to support
the Constitution and the laws, and he had promised that
as soon as one-tenth of the voters in any state (according to
the registration of 1860) should take this oath and establish
a government of republican form, the Federal authorities
would recognize it as a legal state government. Arkansas
and Louisiana
had been reorganized
on this basis,
though the reorganization
proved,
in the end, unsuccessful,
owing to
the fact that Congress
refused to
recognize the governments
thus set
up.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/p447.jpg' alt='' id='p447' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Andrew Johnson.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s564'></a><span class='bold'>564. Johnson’s
Policy of Reconstruction.</span>—The
accession of Johnson
somewhat
modified this policy,
and this modification
has generally
been regarded as calamitous to the South. But it
should be said that Johnson’s policy was not so different
in essentials from that of Lincoln as it was in method and
spirit. Johnson was utterly lacking in the tact that is always
requisite to the successful leadership of men, and consequently
he was soon at odds with Congress. It should also be noted
that Congress fell under the influence of its radical members,
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>
especially Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, and
became more extreme in its methods as soon as the staying
and guiding hand of Lincoln was removed.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s565'></a><span class='bold'>565. Difficult Questions.</span>—Though the war was virtually
over when Johnson came into authority as President, he found
many difficult questions to consider and decide. One of the
first was to determine what should be done with the political
leaders of the Confederacy. In the mountainous region of
Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, where Johnson had lived,
the Union sentiment was so strong that the conflict between
the Unionists and Confederates was greatly embittered. Johnson
now showed much of this spirit of bitterness. In striking
contrast with Lincoln, he took the position that the leaders
of the Confederacy should be put to death. Apparently with
this purpose in view, he offered a reward of one hundred
thousand dollars for the capture of Jefferson Davis, and
smaller sums for the capture of other Confederate leaders.
After a long and difficult pursuit, Davis was captured in
Georgia by two troops of General Wilson’s cavalry, in May,
1865. He was sent to Fortress Monroe, where he was kept a
prisoner for two years. As other members of the Confederate
government were taken, they were sent to various forts to
await the action of Congress. The influence of Seward in
favor of a mild policy, and the doubtful issue of the complicated
constitutional cases that would have come before the
courts, finally brought it to pass that no Confederate leader
was tried for his life. This treatment of the vanquished contrasts
favorably with the methods pursued at the end of the
Revolutionary War in dealing with the Tories.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s566'></a><span class='bold'>566. Difficulties of Reconstruction.</span>—A far more difficult
question to be determined was that of the judicious reëstablishment
of government in the seceded states. This difficulty was
partly the inevitable consequence of a great civil war,<a id='r263'/><a href='#f263' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[263]</span></sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>
partly the result of the peculiar circumstances in which the
North and the South were now placed. The white men of the
South had been at war against the Union, and the slaves had
been set free. Should the former slave owners at once be
allowed to vote? Should the negroes be given a vote? These
were questions of the utmost importance, because the emancipation
of slaves, adopted as a military measure, carried with
it no authority to prevent the reënslaving of negroes after the
war was over (§ <a href='#s546'>546</a>). It was generally felt in the North
that if the old master should be allowed to vote and the
freedman should not be given that privilege, there would be no
assurance that slavery in one form or another would not be
reëstablished. The South, on the other hand, believed that
to give the suffrage to unqualified masses of blacks would be
unnecessary and intolerable. It seemed to be impossible to
reconcile the two views on this question, and consequently the
course to be taken was naturally determined by the party in
power. Moreover, the leading minds of the Republican party
believed that the negro could be thoroughly protected only by
constitutional amendments which would make it impossible
for the united Democrats of the North and the South to
alter whatever measures in his behalf had been taken by
Congress.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s567'></a><span class='bold'>567. Differences between President and Congress.</span>—While a
majority of the people of the North were determined to prevent
the possibility of any form of domination over the negroes,
the President, as a Southern Democrat, cared less for the freedom
of negroes than he did for the right of the white men
in the individual Southern states to settle their own affairs.
Johnson, therefore, was determined that the Confederate states
should come back into the Union under the leadership of their
white voters. This would mean, of course, the leadership of
those who had recently been at war against the Union, and
to such a result the Republican members of Congress were
strongly opposed.
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s568'></a><span class='bold'>568. Provisional Governors.</span>—The President began his policy
by the appointment of a provisional governor for each of the
seceded states. This governor called conventions whose members
were to be elected by such of the former voters as should
take the oath of loyalty contained in the Proclamation of Amnesty.
The conventions showed their loyalty to the Union by
repealing the Ordinances of Secession, by voting that no debt
should ever be paid that had been incurred by the Confederacy,
and by ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution,
which prohibited slavery forever in the country (§ <a href='#s546'>546</a>). But,
on the other hand, some of them also passed laws to force the
freedmen to work, under penalty of imprisonment as vagrants.
To the people of the North this unfortunately looked like an
attempt to set up slavery under another form. It was probably
not so intended, but showed at least great indiscretion.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s569'></a><span class='bold'>569. Refusal of Admission to Congress.</span>—When Congress
met in December, 1865, the members refused to admit the
representatives that had been sent from the seceded states.
They asserted, moreover, that the seceded states were not
in the Union and must be readmitted before their acts could
have authority, and before they could have representation
in Congress. Tennessee was readmitted, and representatives
from this state were received in Congress in 1866, but no other
representatives from seceded states were received until nearly
two years later. The President argued that Congress had no
more right to keep a state out of Congress than a state had to
secede, and in this position he was generally supported by the
Northern Democrats.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s570'></a><span class='bold'>570. The Elections of 1866.</span>—The future of reconstruction
seemed to turn on the result of the elections in the fall of
1866. The Republicans won a large majority of seats, and the
Republican members of the outgoing Congress elected in 1864,
who had a two-thirds majority, secured through representation
of the border states and denial of representation to the seceded
states, saw at once that for the next two years they would be
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>
able to control legislation by passing measures over the President’s
veto. Emboldened by this fact, they now proceeded to
adopt their own plan of reconstruction without waiting for the
next Congress.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s571'></a><span class='bold'>571. Congressional Plan of Reconstruction.</span>—Many theories
were held with regard to the status of the commonwealths that
had seceded. Some persons
held that they were conquered
provinces; others that they
had lost their statehood and
become territories. Others
held that the Southern states
had committed suicide, as it
were, and that the Federal
Constitution and laws did not
apply to them, and would not
until Congress declared them
once more in force. This
theory prevailed in the Congressional
plan of reconstruction,
which was pushed forward
by Thaddeus Stevens,<a id='r264'/><a href='#f264' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[264]</span></sup></a>
of Pennsylvania, chairman of
the Reconstruction Committee
and of the Committee on
Ways and Means, and was adopted in the spring of 1867.
It provided that the negroes should vote, and that the Confederate
leaders should not vote. To insure the permanent
effects of these results, the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution was adopted by Congress, and was ratified July 28,
1868, by the necessary majority of three-fourths of the states.
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s572'></a><span class='bold'>572. The Fourteenth Amendment.</span>—While the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution forever prohibited slavery
within the United States and its dependencies, the Fourteenth
Amendment excluded from Congress and from all civil or
military offices in the United States all persons who, after
having taken the oath to support the Constitution of the United
States, should “have engaged in insurrection or rebellion
against the same, or given aid and comfort to the enemies
thereof,” until Congress, by a two-thirds vote of each House,
should remove such disability. The Fourteenth Amendment
thus had the stupendous effect of disqualifying from holding
office all the most prominent Southern leaders. It also
guaranteed civil and political rights to the negroes, under national
and state governments, and declared invalid all debts
and obligations incurred by the states that had seceded.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s573'></a><span class='bold'>573. Methods of Reconstruction.</span>—On the basis of these
general purposes the work of reconstruction was carried on in
the years 1867 and 1868. Provision was made for civil governments
in each of the states of the former Confederacy, and
for the establishment of live military departments, whose
special duty it was to see that the requirements of Congress in
the reconstruction of the state governments were carried out.</p>

<h3 id='s574a'>EFFECTS OF RECONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s574'></a><span class='bold'>574. Irritation in the South.</span>—This plan of government was
naturally very offensive to the South, for it made the negroes
practically rulers over their former owners. In June, 1868,
the representatives of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana,
North Carolina, and South Carolina were elected under the
new conditions and readmitted to Congress. Those of Georgia,
Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia were not admitted before 1870.
During the first period of reconstruction the freedmen in the
South were generally in control; but the former slaves were
ignorant of political affairs, and had always been in the habit
of acting as they were directed. At first they were under
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>
the influence of the military governments and of the “Carpet
Baggers,” and voted solidly against the whites; but gradually
they yielded to the persuasions of the people who employed
them.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s575'></a><span class='bold'>575. “Carpet Baggers” and “Scalawags.”</span>—The Northerners
who moved into the South after the war for the purpose of
securing office through negro votes were popularly known
as “Carpet Baggers”; and the Southern whites who voted
with the negroes were given the name of “Scalawags.” Between
the “Carpet Baggers” and “Scalawags” on the one
hand, and the old inhabitants on the other, there was bitter
warfare, resulting in murders on both sides. The condition of
the South during this administration and the one following
showed how nearly impossible it is, even under military rule,
to enforce any laws in a community where such laws are
earnestly opposed by a majority or even by a large portion
of the intelligent citizens. The whites were, for the most
part, determined not to let the government fall into the hands
of negroes; and when the blacks abstained from taking part in
the government they were generally not interfered with. In
many localities they were aided and encouraged in their efforts
for improvement; but society in the Southern states found it
hard to adapt itself to the new conditions. The determination
that negroes should not rule was so deep-seated that the purposes
of the government were frustrated in many ways.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s576'></a><span class='bold'>576. The “Ku-Klux-Klan.”</span>—A secret society, known as the
“Ku-Klux-Klan,” was organized, the object of which was to
counteract the influence of “Carpet Baggers,” and to make it
impossible for Northern men to get control of local affairs.
Many Northern men were secretly seized, and some even put to
death, and, for a considerable time, in many parts of the South,
something like a reign of terror prevailed. Gradually, however,
a better feeling was developed; but this was not until both
whites and blacks came to see that the welfare of the negroes
would be better served by industrial and educational than by
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>
political methods. This belief was slow in coming; and it
was not until the administration of President Hayes, about
ten years later, that order and some measure of prosperity were
established.</p>

<h3 id='s577a'>JOHNSON AND CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s577'></a><span class='bold'>577. Strained Relations of President and Congress.</span>—While
these conditions greatly agitated society throughout the South,
the relations of the President and Congress were becoming
more and more strained. Many acts were passed over the
executive veto.<a id='r265'/><a href='#f265' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[265]</span></sup></a> The President kept up the irritation by freely
and offensively accusing the members of keeping Southern
representatives out of Congress in order that they might pass
measures over his veto. His arguments were often powerful,
but his lack of tact prevented him from winning men to his
views. Matters were brought to a crisis by the passage of the
“Tenure of Office Act” in the early part of 1867.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s578'></a><span class='bold'>578. The Tenure of Office Act.</span>—Under the Constitution the
President makes appointments with the advice and consent of
the Senate. The Constitution is silent in regard to the power
of removals; but in 1789 it was decided that removals did not require
the approval of the Senate, but could be made solely at the
discretion of the President. This was the rule until March, 1867,
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>
when Congress passed over the President’s veto the “Tenure of
Office Act,” which provided in substance that no person whose
appointment required the approval of the Senate could be
dismissed without the same approval. In August, 1867, Johnson
requested the resignation of the Secretary of War, Edwin
M. Stanton, who was in sympathy with Congress rather than
with the President. Stanton refused to resign and was suspended,
General Grant taking his place. When Congress met
the suspension was not ratified, and Grant resigned and Stanton
resumed the duties of Secretary. Johnson, who regarded the
Tenure of Office Act as unconstitutional, then removed him.
Stanton, when the Senate had pronounced the removal illegal,
refused to give up his office and appealed to the House of
Representatives.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s579'></a><span class='bold'>579. Impeachment of the President.</span>—The House, in which
a similar attempt had already failed, at once resolved to
impeach the President, by accusing him of having violated
the laws and of being unfit to hold his office. According
to the Constitution, when such a vote takes place, a trial
must be held before the Senate as judges. The Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court is to preside, and, in order to remove
the President, two-thirds of the Senators present must
vote that he is guilty of the crimes or misdemeanors charged
against him. Johnson’s trial, which began on March 5, 1868,
was conducted with great ability on both sides, by several
of the ablest lawyers in the country. In the test vote, taken
on May 16, thirty-five senators pronounced him guilty, and
nineteen not guilty, five Republicans not voting with their
party. As the number thirty-five was less than the requisite
two-thirds, the vote was legally an acquittal of the President,
and Secretary Stanton resigned.<a id='r266'/><a href='#f266' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[266]</span></sup></a> While the trial was in progress,
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>
Johnson made his famous “Swinging round the Circle”
tour in the Northwest and delivered extreme speeches against
Congress.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s580'></a><span class='bold'>580. Election of General Grant.</span>—The Presidential election
of 1868 turned upon the policy of the government in regard to
reconstruction. The
Republican party,
generally supporting
the policy of Congress,
nominated with
enthusiasm and unanimity,
General Ulysses
S. Grant and
Schuyler Colfax of
Indiana. The Democrats,
opposing that
policy, put in the field
Horatio Seymour<a id='r267'/><a href='#f267' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[267]</span></sup></a> of
New York and Frank
P. Blair of Missouri.
The election resulted
in two hundred and
fourteen electoral
votes for the Republican
candidates, and
eighty for the Democratic.
Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia, not having been readmitted,
could not vote.

Among these may be enumerated the Civil Rights Bill, which gave the
negroes citizenship with suffrage (1866), and the Second Freedmen’s Bureau
Bill, which was designed to help the former slaves by securing them employment
and in other ways (1866). The Fourteenth Amendment was also disapproved
by the President, and, of course, the congressional plan of reconstruction.
Congress, by a “rider” to the Army Appropriation Bill, really deprived
the President of his power as commander in chief; and by adopting measures
which enabled a new Congress to meet immediately after the expiration of its
predecessor, took away from the President all opportunity to act upon his own
judgment during the interim between Congresses. In other words, the radical
members of Congress were so determined to carry out their policy that in the
two measures last enumerated and in the Tenure of Office Act they overleaped
the Constitution and practically set up a revolutionary government of their
own. On the other hand, the President’s breach of courtesy in delivering
harangues against Congress, at various points in the country, was highly
exasperating.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s581'></a><span class='bold'>581. Pacific Railroads.</span>—The policy of helping railroad
building by Federal land grants began as early as 1850, when
an important grant was given to aid the construction of the
Illinois Central Railroad. In the course of the next six years
several other grants were made for similar purposes. The
construction of a railroad to the Pacific was recommended by
the Republican platform of 1856; but the project was delayed
by differences between the North and the South in regard to the
location of the road. In 1862 the Union Pacific was projected
to extend from Omaha to Ogden, where it was to connect with
the Central Pacific for San Francisco. Though these roads
were built by private corporations, the latter were largely aided
by Congress.<a id='r268'/><a href='#f268' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[268]</span></sup></a> Besides granting every other section of land
along the routes for a space twenty miles in width, the government
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>
guaranteed the bonds of the corporations to the extent
of over thirty thousand dollars a mile. The roads were
completed in 1869, the first year of Grant’s administration.<a id='r269'/><a href='#f269' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[269]</span></sup></a>
Though the transcontinental lines have not generally proved
profitable to stockholders, they have been of immense advantage
to the country as a whole. Formerly from three to six
weeks were required for the senators and representatives to
reach Washington from California and Oregon; but the railroads
reduced the time to a single week. Another advantage
of far greater importance was the encouragement offered by
the roads to the rapid settlement of the regions through which
they passed. The new Western states increased in population
with amazing rapidity, partly from foreign immigration, and
partly from the migration of people from the Eastern states.
By the census of 1870 it was found that more than a million
inhabitants had already settled along the transcontinental lines.
The Pacific states now for the first time seemed to be an integral
part of the Union.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s582'></a><span class='bold'>582. San Domingo Question.</span>—In 1869 the people of the
Republic of San Domingo expressed a desire to be annexed to
the United States. Grant favored annexation, and a treaty
was drawn up, but the project met with much popular opposition.
A commission, consisting of Senator B. F. Wade of
Ohio, Dr. Samuel G. Howe of Massachusetts, and President
Andrew D. White of Cornell University, was sent to inspect the
island and report upon its condition. The opposition to the
treaty was based principally upon the fact that the people of San
Domingo were chiefly ignorant negroes. Public opinion seemed
not to favor an addition to the number of negroes giving trouble
to the government, and the Senate rejected the treaty.
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s583'></a><span class='bold'>583. Fifteenth Amendment.</span>—In order to improve the status
of the negroes in the South the congressional plan of reconstruction
was supplemented by the adoption, in 1870, of the
Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution. This provided that
no person should thereafter be deprived of the privilege of
voting “because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”
During the same year, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia
were admitted to representation in Congress; and in 1871,
for the first time in ten years, every state in the Union was
duly represented.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s584'></a><span class='bold'>584. Negro Legislation.</span>—The negroes, although the most
ignorant part of the population, were in control of the Southern
legislatures, and their legislation was, as a rule, very crude and
unwise. The white people of the South owned most of the
property, but the blacks, through their control of the legislatures,
to which they often elected unscrupulous white men,
had the power to levy taxes. This fact kept up the violent
opposition on the part of the white population which had
begun under President Johnson. The negroes were sometimes
bribed to keep away from the polls; sometimes threatened with
discharge from employment if they voted; and sometimes were
kept from voting by force. Congress retaliated by penal legislation
against such interference with the negro’s right to
suffrage. So-called “Force Bills” were passed in 1870 and
1871, which increased the bitter feeling in the South. To
preserve order, the provisional governors were obliged to call
on the President for Federal troops. This augmented the
strife, and the Ku-Klux-Klan (§ <a href='#s576'>576</a>) was increasingly active.
Within a year, however, affairs quieted down, a general Amnesty
Act and other milder legislation helped to placate the
whites, and soon the Supreme Court, by important decisions,
made it plain that the individual states, in spite of the new
Constitutional Amendments, could control their own citizens in
many important ways. Thus the fears of the whites that the
blacks would secure permanent control of affairs were allayed.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s585'></a><span class='bold'>585. The Treaty of Washington.</span>—In 1871 a treaty between
the United States and Great Britain was signed at Washington,
by which both nations agreed to submit to arbitration what
were known as the “Alabama Claims,” made by the United
States against Great Britain on account of losses to American
shipping, caused by Confederate privateers fitted out in British
ports (§ <a href='#s502'>502</a>). By the terms of the treaty, the questions
involved were to be settled by a court of five arbitrators, one to
be appointed by each of the governments of the United States,
Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, and Brazil. The Court sat
at Geneva in 1872. Elaborate testimony was offered on both
sides. The United States government was able to show that
the British government had been repeatedly warned of the fitting
out of the <span class='it'>Alabama</span> and other Confederate cruisers. The
Court, after hearing the evidence and arguments, held that
Great Britain had not been duly watchful, as required by international
law, to prevent the use of her ports by the agents
of the Confederacy, and accordingly decided that the British
government should pay to the United States damages to the
amount of fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars in gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s586'></a><span class='bold'>586. Northwest Boundary: Canadian Fisheries.</span>—The Treaty
of Washington also provided for the settlement by arbitration
of two other important questions that had been in dispute for
a considerable time. These were the boundary between the
Oregon region and Canada, not clearly defined by the Treaty
of 1846, and the fishery claims on the northeastern Canadian
coast. By the terms of the Treaty of Washington the boundary
question was submitted to the German Emperor, who gave his
decision, in 1872, in favor of the American claim. The arbitrators
to whom the fisheries question was referred decided
against the United States and that the government should pay
five million five hundred thousand dollars for the use of the
Canadian shores for drying and curing fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s587'></a><span class='bold'>587. Chicago and Boston Fires.</span>—The autumn of 1871 will
long be memorable for one of the most disastrous conflagrations
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>
ever known. In the evening of October 8, a fire broke out in a
stable in West Chicago, and soon spread so that it was beyond
control. Every structure within a space of more than three
square miles in the heart of the city was reduced to ruins.
More than a hundred thousand people were deprived of their
homes, and the loss of property was estimated at more than
two hundred million dollars. In November of the following
year, about seventy-five acres in the richest part of Boston were
burned over, at a loss of about seventy-five million dollars.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s588'></a><span class='bold'>588. Presidential Nominations.</span>—As the end of Grant’s first
term approached it became evident that he would be renominated,
although there were
many disaffected Republicans.
The prevalence
of political scandals and
the continued unsatisfactory
condition of the
South were the most
serious causes of complaint.
The discontented
Republicans clustered
about Horace Greeley<a id='r270'/><a href='#f270' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[270]</span></sup></a>
of New York, and at a
convention held at Cincinnati,
in May, 1872, he
was nominated for President,
with B. Gratz
Brown of Missouri for
Vice President. The platform
adopted charged
the administration with unscrupulous and selfish use of
power in the South, and demanded the immediate substitution
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>
of civil for military power in the Southern states. As
the views promulgated by this platform were substantially
those of the Democratic party, the Greeley platform and candidates
were accepted as their own by the Democratic Convention.
The union, however, was not an auspicious one.
Greeley had been active and influential as a Whig and Republican
and a lifelong opponent of the Democrats, and was
therefore distrusted. Many Democrats regarded the nomination
as a cowardly surrender. The opposition found expression
in a call for a strictly Democratic convention to be held,
September 3, at Louisville, Kentucky. The result was the
nomination of Charles O’Connor of New York for President,
and John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts for Vice President.
As Greeley died a few days after the electors were chosen
and before their vote was cast, the Democratic vote was scattering,
and Grant received two hundred and eighty-six of the
three hundred and forty-nine electoral votes.</p>

<h3 id='s589a'>GRANT’S SECOND ADMINISTRATION, 1873–1877.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s589'></a><span class='bold'>589. Commercial Activity and the Crisis of 1873.</span>—During
Grant’s first administration there was remarkable commercial
activity throughout the country. Money was very abundant,
and prices were high; and, now that the war was over, capital
was everywhere seeking investment in new enterprises. The
war between France and Germany in 1870 and 1871, and the
bad harvests of Europe generally, made a great market for
all American products. An era of railroad construction and
speculation naturally ensued. Everybody seemed to wish to
invest in the new roads, many of which could not pay the
expenses of operation. In the four years of Grant’s first
administration, the mileage of railroads in the country was
increased about fifty per cent; but it soon became apparent that
the work had been enormously overdone. All at once, when
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>
nearly everybody wished to sell, nobody wished to buy. On
September 19, 1873, Jay Cooke &amp; Company, leading bankers
in Philadelphia, failed, and Wall Street in New York was
thrown into such a panic that the day has ever since been
known as “Black Friday.” A financial stringency ensued which
resulted in a universal fall of prices, many failures, and much
distress. It was not until 1879 that prosperity was restored.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s590'></a><span class='bold'>590. Political Scandals.</span>—Grant’s second term was marked
by still greater political scandals than his first. These were
largely due to the spirit of speculation just described. Several
of the new railroad projects were founded on land grants from
Congress, and railroad projectors seemed everywhere desirous
of securing aid from the government. A company, known as
the “Crédit Mobilier,” had been formed to finance the Union
Pacific, and this company distributed stock among men of
influence in a scandalous manner. A Congressional Committee
of Investigation, appointed in December, 1872, reported in
February, 1873, and showed that some of the stock was given
to congressmen, apparently for the purpose of securing their
votes. Two members of the House of Representatives were
formally censured. The spirit of corruption was thought
to have entered the Cabinet, and one Cabinet officer, W. W.
Belknap, Secretary of War, was impeached for receiving bribes,
but escaped dismissal by resignation a few hours before the
House passed the impeaching resolution. Enough senators
held that he was not then impeachable to prevent conviction.
A Whisky Ring was discovered in 1875, that had been
organized by Federal officials and distillers for the purpose
of defrauding the government of the taxes due on the manufacture
of whisky. Numerous Indian uprisings were found to
be largely the result of dishonest methods practiced by Indian
commissioners and contractors in cheating Indians out of their
just dues. While no scandal of any kind ever attached to Grant
himself, it was widely felt that he was overindulgent to
officials of questionable honesty. Mainly in consequence of
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>
these scandals, there was a general outcry from the public, and
a demand for a different system of appointment to all the minor
civil offices.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s591'></a><span class='bold'>591. Extravagance of Congress.</span>—The spirit of dissatisfaction
that prevailed among the people at large was much intensified
in 1873 by the action of Congress in raising the salaries of a
large number of Federal officers. The salary of the President
was advanced from twenty-five thousand to fifty thousand
dollars a year; and the salary of congressmen was increased
from five thousand dollars to seven thousand. In the case of
congressmen, the increase was made to apply to the Congress
then in session. The act raised a storm of indignation throughout
the country. It was the back-pay clause, known as the
“salary grab,” that was particularly obnoxious. Nearly all
those members who voted for the increase were defeated at
the next election; and so much of the measure as related to
congressmen was repealed at the next session.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s592'></a><span class='bold'>592. Civil Service Reform.</span>—To give voice to the demands for
improvement in the public service, a National Civil Service
Reform Association was organized, which devoted itself to
agitation favoring new methods of appointment. From the
time of Jackson, the custom had been growing for a new President
to turn out of office those who had actively opposed him,
and to appoint those who had actively supported him. The
numerous scandals in Grant’s administration were thought to
result largely from this system, and a demand for reform
became general. The first Civil Service Reform Law was
passed March 3, 1871. This law authorized the President to
frame and administer such rules as he deemed best for the
regulation of appointments in the Civil Service. The measure
received Grant’s approval, and he appointed the distinguished
author and orator George William Curtis, an earnest advocate
of reform, as the head of a Board of Commissioners, who were
to examine candidates for the minor positions and report the
results to the President. From those who passed the examinations
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>
most successfully, the President was to make the appointments.
For three years this system of competitive examinations
was followed; but, as congressmen were thus deprived of the
privilege of recommending constituents for appointment, Congress
in 1874 refused to vote money to maintain the commission,
and the work was thus temporarily frustrated. This was
also a period of local political corruption. The Tammany
Society, under its “Boss,” William Marcy Tweed, governed
New York City in a most scandalous and extravagant fashion.
Finally, owing to exposures made in 1871, chiefly through the
agency of the New York <span class='it'>Times</span>, Tweed was brought to trial and
convicted.<a id='r271'/><a href='#f271' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[271]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s593'></a><span class='bold'>593. Indian Troubles.</span>—During both of Grant’s administrations
Indian troubles were serious, partly in consequence of
the political corruption of the period (§ <a href='#s590'>590</a>). In the course
of the Civil War, the Sioux in Minnesota, taking advantage of
the absence of the United States troops, had risen in rebellion
and massacred a considerable number of the inhabitants.
With some difficulty the agitators were captured, and thirty-four
of them were simultaneously hanged on a single gallows
at Mankato. This striking exhibition of energy on the part of
the government put an end to revolts for a time, but relief was
only temporary. The Modocs, in southern Oregon, when ordered
to another reservation in 1873, refused to go, and even put to
death the peace commissioner sent to deal with them. They
were finally subdued, after nearly a year of fighting. In 1875
the Sioux again arose, under the leadership of Sitting Bull;
but they were gradually driven west as far as the Little Big
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
Horn River in southern Montana. Here they were imprudently
attacked by General George A. Custer,<a id='r272'/><a href='#f272' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[272]</span></sup></a> who, with his regiment,
was surrounded and every member of the force with one exception
was killed
(June 25, 1876).
Fresh troops finally
repulsed the Indians
and they withdrew
into British America.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s594'></a><span class='bold'>594. The Virginius
Affair.</span>—Good sense
on both sides averted
hostilities in another
quarter. In October,
1873, an American
merchant vessel, the
<span class='it'>Virginius</span>, was captured
on the high
seas, near Jamaica, by
a Spanish man-of-war,
on the ground that it
intended to land men
to assist in the Cuban
insurrection then in
progress. Several Cubans, with Captain Fry and a number of
other persons found among the passengers, were seized and
executed. The event caused not a little excitement in the
United States. Spain made immediate and ample reparation;
but the incident served to increase the filibustering spirit
toward Cuba that had long been prevalent, especially in the
South.

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s595'></a><span class='bold'>595. The Centennial. Exposition.</span>—In the last year of Grant’s
second administration,<a id='r273'/><a href='#f273' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[273]</span></sup></a> the fact that “peace hath her victories
no less renowned than war” was strikingly proved. The centennial
of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence
was celebrated by a great International Industrial Exposition
at Philadelphia. It was also, as an undertaking of all the
states, a sign of real national unity after years of strife. The
exposition was opened in May, 1876, and was visited by millions
of people, drawn from all parts of the country and from
Europe. The superiority of the United States in various kinds
of labor-saving machines and inventions, among them telephones
and appliances for electric lighting, was a source of national
pride; and the cause of popular education was served by the
exhibition of the mechanical and artistic achievements of foreign
nations.</p>

<h3 id='s596a'>PARTY POLITICS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s596'></a><span class='bold'>596. The Greenback Party.</span>—As early as 1863 the principal
and interest of the national bonds had been made payable in
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>
coin. But as the price of gold rose,—or, more properly
speaking, the price of paper notes fell,—it was possible to
sell bonds and with the gold and silver thus received to purchase
greenbacks, and thus apparently to double the rate of
interest. As the bonds were largely held by rich men, an
outcry rose that the law should be changed, and that all
bonds should be made payable, principal and interest, in greenbacks.
Public feeling culminated in a political convention at
Indianapolis, November 25, 1874, in which a demand was made
for a general substitution of a paper currency in place of coin.
The Greenback Party, as it was called, nominated Peter
Cooper of New York for President in 1876, and he received
eighty-one thousand seven hundred and forty votes, mostly in
the Central and Western states. During the same period
organizations of farmers, known as Granges, demanded, and
in some states secured, the moderation of railroad rates.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Rutherford B. Hayes.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s597'></a><span class='bold'>597. The Campaign of 1876.</span>—As the election of 1876 approached,
it became evident that the people were growing more
and more to distrust the policy of keeping the reconstructed
governments in place by military force, and that the question of
interfering in local affairs in the South would play a large part
in the campaign. The Democrats were growing in strength,
while the Republicans were weakening. At their party convention,
the Democrats nominated Samuel J. Tilden of New
York for President, and Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana for
V%ice President; while the Republicans placed in the field
Rutherford B. Hayes<a id='r274'/><a href='#f274' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[274]</span></sup></a> of Ohio, and William A. Wheeler of
New York. It was evident from the first that the contest
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
would be a very close one. The election revealed that the
decision of the Electoral College, as the Presidential electors
in their collective capacity
are called, would turn
upon the manner in which
certain disputed returns
in Florida, Louisiana, Oregon,
and South Carolina
were decided. If these
states should all be represented
in the College
by Republican electors,
Hayes would have a majority
of one. If from
a single one of those
states a Democratic elector
should obtain a vote, the
election would go to
Tilden.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s598'></a><span class='bold'>598. The Question in
Dispute.</span>—From each of
the states in dispute, two
sets of returns were presented
to Congress, one certifying that Republican, the other
that Democratic, electors had been chosen. In each of the
Southern states there was a returning board that was recognized
by the government at Washington, to which the results of the
elections from various precincts were to be reported, and whose
duty it was to declare the result, which was to be certified, by
the governor, to Congress. These boards, therefore, had almost
unlimited authority. In making up the returns in Florida and
Louisiana, they cast out the vote of certain precincts, declaring
that the election had been tainted with fraud and violence.
This the Democrats denied, and made out returns of their own,
certifying that the Democratic electors had been chosen. In
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>
South Carolina there were two sets of returns emanating from
two contending state governments. The Democrats claimed
that Federal troops had interfered with the results of the election.
In Oregon the question as to whether there should be
three Republican electors or two
Republican and one Democratic,
hinged on the validity of a protest
that a postmaster could not
under the Constitution be an elector.
As the Republicans had a
majority in the Senate and the
Democrats in the House, it was
evident there could be no agreement
on a count of the votes.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/p471.jpg' alt='' id='p471' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Samuel J. Tilden.</span><a id='r275'/><a href='#f275' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[275]</span></sup></a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s599'></a><span class='bold'>599. Electoral Commission.</span>—The
importance of the question
caused great anxiety from November until March. The result
involved not only an entire change of national policy with
regard to the South, but also the tenure of nearly one hundred
thousand officials. There was talk of another civil war. For
weeks the matter was debated in Congress, with no result.
As the time for inauguration approached, the most temperate
men on both sides agreed upon an Electoral Commission, to
whom the whole matter should be submitted for decision.
Such decision was to be final, unless both Senate and House
agreed in rejecting it. The commission was to consist of five
members of the House (three of them Democrats), five Senators
(three of them Republicans), and five members of the Supreme
Court (two Democrats, two Republicans, and one Independent).
It turned out that the only Independent member of the Supreme
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
Court, David Davis, resigned in order to accept a seat in the
Senate. He therefore could not serve, and after some delay a
Republican was put in his place. All the points in dispute
were ably presented and argued. A bare majority of the
Commission decided that they could not accept returns that
were not regularly certified to and that they must accept
those of the duly authorized returning boards. Accordingly,
the questions in regard to each of the states involved were decided
in favor of the Republicans, by a vote of eight to seven,
all the Republicans voting one way and all the Democrats the
other. As the Republican Senate would not vote to reject this
result, it was conclusive, and Hayes was declared elected. The
question was not settled, however, till March 2, two days before
the inauguration. The feeling on the part of the Democrats
throughout the country was naturally intense; but the decision
was legal, and no formal objection to it could be made.
Thus Hayes and Wheeler were chosen by an electoral vote of
one hundred and eighty-five, while Tilden and Hendricks
received one hundred and eighty-four. Nothing has ever
occurred in the history of our government to subject the
Constitution to so violent a strain; and nothing could be more
creditable to the sense of loyalty on the part of the aggrieved
portion of the people than their peaceful submission to the
results of the legal decision. Recent opinion seems to be
favorable to the technical merits of Tilden’s claims, yet it is
generally conceded that the country, on the whole, profited
from the actual course of events.</p>

Tweed (1823–1878) was a son of a chair-maker which trade he first followed.
He became a power in local politics through the influence he acquired as a
popular member of a fire company. He served as alderman and congressman,
but did his chief plundering as commissioner of public works of New York City.
He was finally convicted in 1873 and imprisoned and fined, but in 1875 his imprisonment
was declared illegal. Civil suits were still pending against him
and the enormous bail of $3,000,000 was required, in default of which he was put
in jail. He escaped to Cuba and Spain, but was brought back and died in jail.</p>

Though President Grant’s public career ended with his second administration,
which had been greatly discredited, the last years of his life made a
deep impression on the people at large. Soon after the close of his second
term he made a journey around the world, and, wherever he went, honors
were showered upon him. In China, in Germany, and in Great Britain it
was especially evident that the greatness of his military career had made
a profound impression. After his return, two events deeply moved the
public sympathy. In the first place, he had intrusted nearly all of his moderate
fortune to a banking house in New York, in whose managers he had
shown an unjustifiable confidence. The bank failed so disastrously that
Grant felt compelled to offer for sale the various swords that had been
presented to him, as well as other important memorials of the war. These
were purchased by William H. Vanderbilt for one hundred thousand dollars,
and given to the nation for preservation in the Smithsonian Institution. In
the second place, it became evident, in 1884 that his life was in immediate
peril from an incurable disease. Fully realizing that his death was approaching,
he set about the preparation of his <span class='it'>Memoirs</span>, in the hope that the sale of
the work would aid in furnishing support for the dependent members of his
family. Though tortured by excruciating pain, he pushed on the work in
the most heroic manner and was able to complete it just before his death,
in July, 1885. The great merits of these two volumes secured for them an
instant public reception, and the heroism and the pathos of the great soldier’s
last days very deeply touched the popular heart.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br/> <span class='bold'><span class='sc'>the administrations of hayes and of garfield and arthur, 1877–1885.</span></span></h2>

<h3 id='s600a'><span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s600'></a><span class='bold'>600. General Character of the Administration of Hayes.</span>—The
administration of Hayes was one of adjustment to new conditions
rather than one of great political innovations. During
the first half of his term, the Democrats had a majority in the
House, the Republicans in the Senate; during the second half,
the Democrats controlled both branches of Congress. By reason
of these facts, and of the more or less general feeling that
the President’s title to his position was not perfect, radical
legislation was impossible, and industrial questions occupied
in the main the attention of the country. Hayes himself,
although much harassed by difficulties with Congress, wielded
his power, especially that of the veto,<a id='r276'/><a href='#f276' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[276]</span></sup></a> in a most creditable
manner, and surrounded himself with a Cabinet of good
advisers.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s601'></a><span class='bold'>601. Withdrawal of Troops from the South.</span>—One of the first
acts of President Hayes’s administration was to order the
withdrawal of the United States troops from the South, where
they had been stationed for the protection of the reconstructed
governments. The way for this movement had been prepared
during the last days of Grant’s administration; for it had come
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
to be seen that good order could not be reëstablished by force.
Democrats replaced Republicans in state offices, and everywhere
the supremacy of the white people of the South was at
once established. It was a practical confession that the
methods of reconstruction adopted by Congress had not been
successful. From this time forward the South was able to
give attention to industrial recuperation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s602'></a><span class='bold'>602. Disorders and Riots.</span>—During 1877, the first year of
Hayes’s administration, railroad strikes were common. Freight
charges were being reduced, and the roads, finding it impossible
to maintain the old rate of wages, attempted to lower the
price of labor. Thousands refused to work at the new rates,
and some of the workmen would not allow trains to run. At
Chicago, St. Louis, and Baltimore there were riots, in which
several persons were killed; but the most serious outbreak
occurred at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where nearly a hundred
lives were lost and the destruction of property amounted to
about three million dollars. Pennsylvania had several years
before suffered from the outrages of a secret society of miners
known as the “Molly McGuires,” which was not finally put
down until 1875.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s603'></a><span class='bold'>603. Chinese Immigration.</span>—For the construction of the Pacific
railroads, large numbers of Chinese laborers had been induced
to come to the Pacific coast. These immigrants did not become
citizens, and consequently did not vote. The fact that they
could live more cheaply, and therefore work for less wages,
than the white laborers, aroused great opposition to their
presence, and riots became common. In response to this outcry,
in 1880 a treaty was negotiated with China, by which it
was agreed that Chinese immigration might be stopped by the
United States government. This was followed, in 1882, by an
Act of Congress forbidding such immigration for ten years.
The law was imperfectly drawn, however, and its principal
effect was to prevent the Chinese from coming in large masses.
More stringent measures were enacted later (§ <a href='#s624'>624</a>).
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span></p>

<h3 id='s604a'>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s604'></a><span class='bold'>604. Relations of Gold and Silver.</span>—Public opinion during
Hayes’s term was seriously agitated in regard to the relations
of silver and gold. In 1873, during Grant’s administration, a
law had been passed, in consequence of a general advance in
the price of silver, discontinuing the coinage of silver dollars,
which had long been practically out of circulation. But by
1878 the price of the metal had fallen on account of the large
output of the Western mines, and Congress decided to remonetize
silver by providing that a certain amount should be purchased
and coined each month. An act was passed, known as
the “Bland-Allison Bill,” which provided for the purchase and
coinage into dollars of not less than two million, nor more than
four million, dollars’ worth of silver each month. The coining
was to be at the rate of sixteen to one; that is to say, sixteen
pounds of silver was to be coined into the same number of dollars
as one pound of gold. As so much silver in circulation would
prove inconvenient, Congress provided for depositing the silver
thus coined in the Treasury and issuing silver certificates as
currency in its place. This legislation, which was passed over
the President’s veto and was regarded by economists as unsound,
stimulated the production of silver and greatly encouraged the
new mining industries in Colorado, Nevada, and the other states
of the far West.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s605'></a><span class='bold'>605. Resumption of Specie Payments.</span>—Ever since the first
year of the war, the paper money which has already been
described (§ <a href='#s596'>596</a>) had been the only currency in common use.
Greenbacks and national bank notes had been made legal tender
for most purposes; but the Supreme Court had at one time
decided against, and at another time in favor of, the power of
Congress to make a legal tender out of paper not redeemable
in coin. In consequence there was a feeling of uncertainty
with regard to the value of the currency in which business was
transacted, and this was harmful to the commercial interests
of the country. The paper had depreciated in value as compared
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
with gold, and many people urged that the government
should pay its debts in it. This hurt the national credit.
Accordingly, in January, 1875, an act was passed providing for
resumption of specie payments on the 1st of January, 1879.
In other words, after the latter date, any person could get
coin from the Treasury in exchange for the paper he offered.
In the course of the four intervening years, the government
accumulated a large amount of gold and silver in the Treasury
and prepared itself to meet such demands as might be made.
It happened, however, as it usually does under similar conditions
with local banks, that so long as the people knew that
the government was able and ready to pay, they had no desire
for actual payment. They at once settled into the belief that
paper was more convenient than coin. The chief credit for
this financial legislation belongs to John Sherman, brother of
the famous general, who long represented Ohio in the Senate,
and at the time of resumption was Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h3 id='s606a'>POLITICAL AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s606'></a><span class='bold'>606. Causes of Dissatisfaction.</span>—Though President Hayes’s
administration was free from scandals and was one of uniform
excellence, it presented very few characteristics that appealed
to the enthusiastic admiration of the people. Nor was the
President popular with the political managers, who thought
that greater energy on his part would have secured such popular
favor as to overcome the Democratic majority in Congress.
As the time for the next Republican nomination drew near,
it became evident, therefore, that Hayes, who did not seek a
second term, would not be renominated.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>General Winfield S. Hancock.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s607'></a><span class='bold'>607. Nomination and Election of Garfield and Arthur.</span>—The
Republican Convention, which met at Chicago in 1880, after a
long struggle between the supporters of J. G. Blaine and of
General Grant, nominated, as a compromise, James A. Garfield
of Ohio for President, and Chester A. Arthur of New York
for Vice President. Garfield, having distinguished himself in
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>
military service and in the House of Representatives, had
recently been elected to the Senate. Arthur, without legislative
experience, had been Collector of the Port of New York. The
Democrats met at Cincinnati, and nominated General Winfield
S. Hancock<a id='r277'/><a href='#f277' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[277]</span></sup></a> of Pennsylvania
for President, and William
H. English of Indiana for
Vice President. There was
no such heated contest for
the nominations as there had
been among the Republicans,
for the general prosperity of
the country indicated that the
party in power would not be
turned out. This forecast
proved to be correct, for at
the election Garfield and
Arthur received two hundred
and fourteen electoral votes,
while Hancock and English
received one hundred and
fifty-five. The defeated candidates
received their main vote from what began to be called
“the Solid South,”—that is to say, not only the states that
had seceded, but all those in which slavery had existed at the
time of the war. Until the election of 1896, this solid mass of
electoral votes went to Democratic candidates.

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>James A. Garfield.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s608'></a><span class='bold'>608. Factions in the Republican Party.</span>—Even before the
nomination of Garfield<a id='r278'/><a href='#f278' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[278]</span></sup></a> and Arthur, it was evident that the
Republican party was inclined to divide into two factional
sections. The questions at issue related partly to the method
of appointing the
minor government
officers and partly
to the attitude of
the party toward
the South. In general,
those Republicans
who were
popularly known
as “Stalwarts”
advocated a more
rigorous policy
toward the South
than Hayes had
pursued; while the
other division of
the party, contemptuously
called
“Half-breeds” by
their opponents,
supported the administration
of Hayes and approved of the withdrawal of troops.
The “Half-breeds,” moreover, advocated a reform of the Civil
Service, while the “Stalwarts” insisted that the offices should
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
be given to those who had consistently supported the party.
Garfield was supposed to represent the “Half-breeds,” while
Arthur was nominated as a representative of the “Stalwarts.”
The leader of the latter was Senator Roscoe Conkling of New
York, a brilliant orator, notorious for the violence of his
partisanship. Conkling had been a stanch supporter of General
Grant for the nomination in 1880; but, although he helped
Garfield in the canvass preceding the latter’s election, he was
soon at odds with the new administration on the question of
appointments. He did not like the selection of Blaine for
Secretary of State, and was aggrieved by other selections of
Cabinet advisers made by the new President. Garfield was
amply justified in resisting dictation from Conkling and other
leaders with regard to appointments, for the platform on which
he was nominated had called for a “thorough, radical, and
complete reform of the Civil Service.” Moreover, he had been
nominated without having been announced as a candidate in
advance of the nomination, and had made few, if any, promises
to bestow offices on special men.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s609'></a><span class='bold'>609. Strife for Offices: Assassination of Garfield.</span>—Soon after
the election, the strife for offices became unusually intense.
Many of the senators, acting in accordance with former custom,
continued to insist upon practically dictating who should be
appointed within their own states; but the President continued
to resist them. When he refused to appoint as Collector of
the Port of New York the candidate whom Senators Conkling
and Platt had urged for the place, these “Stalwarts” were
intensely indignant and resigned their seats in the Senate.
The New York legislature expressed its disapproval of their
course, by refusing to reëlect them.<a id='r279'/><a href='#f279' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[279]</span></sup></a> The result was not a
little agitation and bitterness between the two factions, which
perhaps was partly responsible for the assassination of the
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>
President by a fanatic
named Charles J. Guiteau,
to whom an office had
been refused. Garfield
was shot on the 2d of July,
1881, just as he was about
to take a train at the Pennsylvania
Railroad station
in Washington. After
lingering in great pain,
but with heroic endurance,
for nearly three months,
he died, September 19, at
Elberon, New Jersey.
His death called forth
sincere expressions of
sympathy from all parts
of the world. Arthur<a id='r280'/><a href='#f280' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[280]</span></sup></a>
was at once sworn in as
President. Guiteau, after
a long trial, was adjudged
not insane, but responsible for his act, and was hanged.</p>

<h3 id='s610a'>CHIEF FEATURES OF ARTHUR’S ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Chester A. Arthur.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s610'></a><span class='bold'>610. Success of Arthur.</span>—The effect of the assassination was
everywhere deeply felt throughout the country, and the impression
was almost universal that in the death of Garfield
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>
the nation had suffered an irreparable loss. President Arthur,
however, at once showed that he was a man of firmness, intelligence,
and good judgment, fully capable of filling satisfactorily
his great office. He chose a good Cabinet, his Secretary of
the Navy, William E. Chandler, being especially energetic in increasing
the efficiency of that branch of the service. Arthur’s
recommendations to Congress were judicious, and in the case
of Civil Service legislation, the need for which had been emphasized
by President Garfield’s assassination, particularly
important (§ <a href='#s616'>616</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s611'></a><span class='bold'>611. Feats of Engineering.</span>—Arthur’s administration was
marked by several great triumphs of engineering. In 1881 the
completion of the Brooklyn Bridge was celebrated. This
structure, the main avenue of traffic between New York and
Brooklyn, and the longest and boldest suspension bridge in
the world, was designed in 1869 by John A. Roebling, an
engineer who had designed and constructed the first suspension
bridge across Niagara River below the Falls. The
Washington monument (dedicated in 1885), the highest stone
structure in the world, was also completed during Arthur’s
administration, after great delay and certain difficulties of construction
which were finally obviated by engineering skill.
The monument is an obelisk of white marble, five hundred
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>
and fifty-five feet high, and is impressive in its simple grandeur.<a id='r281'/><a href='#f281' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[281]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s612'></a><span class='bold'>612. Condition of the Lower Mississippi.</span>—About this time
the attention of the country was called to the difficulty of protecting
the inhabitants of the lower Mississippi Valley against
the dangers of inundation. The waters of the Mississippi and
of the Missouri bring down enormous amounts of earth, which
are deposited, partly in the bottom of the former river and
partly in the Gulf of Mexico. This continuous deposit gradually
raises the channel, so that, in places, the bed of the river
is higher than the surrounding country. It also fills up the
mouth of the stream and obstructs navigation. During the
administration of Hayes a system of jetties, consisting of thousands
of bundles of fagots, was devised for the purpose of
narrowing the channel, and by so doing, increasing the current
so that the silt or mud might be carried far out into the Gulf.
This plan was due to Engineer James B. Eads, who had distinguished
himself by the construction of ironclads during the
war and of the great steel arch bridge across the river at St. Louis.
The jetty system was temporarily successful, but it did not
prevent the gradual rising of the river bed and consequent
inundations. In the first year of Arthur’s administration, as
many as a hundred thousand people were driven from their
homes and vast amounts of property were destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s613'></a><span class='bold'>613. Notable Events.</span>—In 1881 the nation celebrated with a
great naval display the one hundredth anniversary of the surrender
of the British at Yorktown. In recognition of the
country’s friendship for Great Britain, President Arthur, with
characteristic tact, ordered at the end of the ceremonies a
national salute to the British flag. In 1884 a World’s Industrial
and Cotton Centennial Exposition was held at New Orleans,
which revealed the increasing prosperity of the country at
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>
large and of the South in particular. The years 1881–1884
were also notable for brave Arctic explorations conducted by
Lieutenant A. W. Greely.</p>

<h3 id='s614a'>POLITICAL EVENTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s614'></a><span class='bold'>614. Anti-Polygamy Law.</span>—For many years polygamy among
the Mormons had given offense to a vast majority of the people
of the country. The practice had been supposed to be so essentially
a part of the Mormon religious system that Congress had
hesitated to interfere with it. In 1882, however, Senator George
F. Edmunds of Vermont succeeded in carrying through Congress
a law which repealed the charter of the Mormon church,
made polygamy criminal in any territory of the United States,
and deprived of the elective franchise any persons who should
refuse to take the oath to obey the stringent provisions of
the act.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s615'></a><span class='bold'>615. Tariff Commission.</span>—The tariff and internal revenue
laws, enacted in 1862, for the purpose of raising a war income
(§§ <a href='#s456'>456</a>, <a href='#s457'>457</a>), produced so large an income that the national
debt was greatly reduced and a large surplus accumulated in the
Treasury. This surplus could not be used to pay the debt,
because the latter had been refunded,—that is, loosely speaking,
readjusted on subsequent borrowing at a lower rate of
interest than was paid when the debt was first incurred,—and
the new obligations had not yet fallen due. It was therefore
deemed desirable to reduce the income by a modification of the
tariff. As questions of protection and free trade were not the
chief motives of the change, it was decided to appoint a Tariff
commission of business men to study the matter and report a
suitable bill to Congress. On the basis of the recommendations
of the Commission, a law was framed and passed in 1883; but
it failed to diminish the income, and the accumulations in the
Treasury went on as rapidly as before. It was thought, however,
that the Commission had been influenced too much by the
urgent recommendations of the protectionists. The final action
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>
was regarded by Democrats and by advocates of free trade as
amounting to excessive taxation, and so an active agitation
was begun in favor of a more liberal tariff law (§ <a href='#s627'>627</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s616'></a><span class='bold'>616. Condition of the Civil Service.</span>—The murder of Garfield
called attention anew to the bad condition of the Civil Service.
It was evident that the number of appointments to be made
had become so great that the President was obliged to give too
much of his time to the subject, and even then thousands of
offices had to be bestowed on the demand of politicians who
showed little sense of responsibility in making their recommendations.
Congress, therefore, in 1883, revived the Civil
Service question that had been dropped in the time of President
Grant, and the so-called “Pendleton Bill,” supported by
Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio, was enacted. According
to this law, a large number of subordinate appointments
were to be made by the President from those candidates who
had been most successful in competitive examinations. These
examinations were to be held by a Board of Commissioners,
duly provided by Congress for the purpose. This method had
been very successful in other countries and had been approved
and encouraged by Grant, Hayes, and Garfield. Under the
act a Commission was appointed, which has been continued and
has rendered great service to the country.</p>

during Arthur’s administration passed through a period of
prosperity, which, up to that time, was unexampled. Agriculture,
trade, and manufactures everywhere flourished. Laborers
found abundant employment. The South had, for the first time
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
since the war, become somewhat prosperous. Free labor was
proving more profitable than slave labor, and new industries of
various kinds began to spring up in all parts of the Southern
states. Manufactories of cotton goods, which, up to the time
of the war, had flourished only in the North, now made a beginning
in the South. Industrial expositions showed that a
New South had come into existence. But in some Southern
states, notably Virginia, where there was great agitation for the
adjustment of the state debt, politics were still in a bad condition.
On the Pacific coast, agitation on the part of more or less
shiftless citizens, not only against Chinese immigration but also
against the moneyed classes,—known from its leader, Dennis
Kearney, as Kearneyism,—was quieting down, and the lawlessness
of the Middle West, represented by the crimes of Jesse
James and his fellow train robbers, was finally suppressed.
Toward the end of Arthur’s administration much attention
was called to the growth of corporations. In 1884 an “Anti-Monopoly”
party was organized, and General Benjamin F.
Butler was nominated for President.</p>

<h3 id='s618a'>THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1884.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s618'></a><span class='bold'>618. Demands for Reform.</span>—As the time for the election of
1884 approached, it was evident that demands for further Civil
Service improvement and for tariff reform were to play a very
prominent part in the campaign. Many Republicans insisted
upon the selection of candidates who would support measures
of reform, and threatened, in case such nominations should not
be made, to vote for the Democratic candidates. Such advocates
of reform called themselves “Independents”; but they
were stigmatized by their enemies as “Mugwumps.”<a id='r283'/><a href='#f283' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[283]</span></sup></a> These
Independent voters proved to be sufficiently numerous to decide
the coming election.

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s619'></a><span class='bold'>619. Election of Cleveland.</span>—The Republican Convention met
at Chicago and nominated James Gillespie Blaine<a id='r284'/><a href='#f284' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[284]</span></sup></a> of Maine
for President, and General John A. Logan of Illinois for Vice
President. Blaine had long been one of the most prominent
men in the Republican party.
Possessed of much personal
charm, he enjoyed great popularity
with those with whom
he came into personal contact.
For six years he was Speaker
of the House of Representatives,
and when the Democrats
secured a majority in the
House, he became the brilliant
leader of the Republicans on
the floor. While he occupied
this position, however, it began
to be whispered that his
career was not free from acts
involving corrupt motives.
An investigation followed in
regard to his connection with
the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union
Pacific Railroad Company. The evidence had a serious
effect upon his political prospects. Many Republicans, believing
him not free from the taint of corruption, were ready
from the time of his nomination to vote against him. The
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span>
Democrats, who also convened at Chicago, nominated, for
President, Grover Cleveland,<a id='r285'/><a href='#f285' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[285]</span></sup></a> who had recently shown great
strength as governor of New York, and Thomas A. Hendricks
of Indiana for Vice President. The campaign was an unusually
spirited one, full of unseemly personalities. Some of
the Reform Republicans finally made up their minds to support
Blaine; but others, like George William Curtis, advocated
Cleveland’s election. Blaine’s cause was greatly injured by
the extravagant attacks made upon the Democrats by some of
his supporters. Cleveland and Hendricks were finally elected
by an electoral vote of two hundred and nineteen against one
hundred and eighty-two. The election was decided by the
thirty-five electoral votes of New York, secured by a majority
of less than twelve hundred. The vote showed that Blaine was
defeated by those Independent Republicans who distrusted his
political integrity.</p>

<h3 id='s620a'><span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>IMPORTANT MEASURES AND REFORMS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s620'></a><span class='bold'>620. Character of the Administration.</span>—Ever since Grant’s
administrations the strength of the two great political parties
had been tending more and more to an equality. When Cleveland
entered upon his duties as President, the Democrats had a
small majority in the House of Representatives, the Republicans
still had a majority in the Senate. Legislation, therefore, was
for the most part confined to non-partisan measures. Cleveland
surrounded himself with a good group of Cabinet advisers, in
which the South was allowed proportionate representation.<a id='r286'/><a href='#f286' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[286]</span></sup></a>
The latter fact, together with his policy of vetoing private pension
bills, rendered the President unpopular with many Union
veterans; but his general firmness and honesty as an executive
were admitted by impartial observers. He was placed, however,
in the unfortunate situation of having to offend either the
Democrats, who demanded that all offices should be taken away
from Republican incumbents and given to Democrats, or the
Independents, who thought that removals from office should be
made only in the case of unworthy incumbents. Cleveland
extended Civil Service reform, but at the same time made some
removals from office apparently on partisan grounds. Thus
he offended both Democratic politicians and Independent reformers;
<span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span>
and his administration, while on the whole successful,
was not characterized by thorough harmony.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s621'></a><span class='bold'>621. The Australian Ballot.</span>—Cleveland’s first administration
was not only marked by the improvement in the Civil Service
consequent upon
the President’s extending
the number
of offices to be
filled by persons
who had passed
competitive examinations,
but was
also distinguished
by a reform which
helped greatly to
purify elections.
In order to secure
the secret voting
necessary to lessen
intimidation
and bribery of
voters, the Australian
ballot was
adopted in several
of the states. The
essential principle
of this ballot is
that all the candidates’ names shall be printed upon a single
sheet of paper, and that the voter, taking this official paper
from the supervisor of the election, shall, in a booth by himself,
secretly mark the name of the person or persons for whom
he votes, and then, after folding the ballot, return it to the
officer to be inserted in the ballot box. The method met with
popular approval and was adopted, in the course of a few years,
in nearly all the states.
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s622'></a><span class='bold'>622. The Presidential Succession Act, and the Electoral Count
Act.</span>—Two measures intended to obviate possible complications
in Presidential elections were adopted during this administration.
Before 1886 there was no law to determine how the
Presidency should be filled in case of the death or disability of
the President, the Vice President, and the Acting President of
the Senate.<a id='r287'/><a href='#f287' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[287]</span></sup></a> It was now determined by statute that the succession
should pass from the Vice President to the members
of the Cabinet, eligible in the order in which the several departments
were created, beginning with the Secretary of State.
The following year (1887) the Electoral Count Act determined
that disputes relating to the validity of electoral votes should
be settled by state tribunals.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s623'></a><span class='bold'>623. Interstate Commerce Act.</span>—The rapid growth of individual
and corporate wealth in the country led to an impression
on the part of very many people that the profits of industry
were not fairly distributed. This feeling was greatly increased
by the multiplication of corporations and trusts. Railways
were everywhere tending to combine into great lines and to
enter into agreements that were supposed to endanger competition
and sometimes even to prevent it. It was also in their
power to make such discriminating rates for freight between different
manufacturing corporations and between different towns
and cities as to favor some and injure others. This condition
led to strikes and riots at various points, and it became
evident to the leaders of both parties that remedial legislation
was called for. The result was the passing of an act for the
better regulation of Interstate Commerce. Railroads exclusively
within an individual state could not, under the Constitution
of the United States, be interfered with; but the act
forbade discriminating rates and the pooling of earnings and
rates on roads running partly in one state and partly in
another. It also created an Interstate Commerce Commission
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>
of five members, with authority to decide such questions under
the act as might arise between the railroads and their patrons,
and to make an annual report on actual conditions. The Commission,
however, was not given power to enforce its decisions,
and, consequently, it failed to accomplish all the good that had
been anticipated; but many abuses were corrected. Individual
states, also, in many cases enacted laws limiting the rates for
carrying freight and passengers.</p>

<h3 id='s624a'>INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL DISTURBANCES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s624'></a><span class='bold'>624. Anti-Chinese Laws.</span>—The strikes and other disorders
prevalent during this period in many parts of the country were
generally attributed to ignorant foreigners, who had not yet
become accustomed to American laws. Immigration brought
in a large number of discontented, disheartened, and reckless
people from Europe. Efforts were now made to reduce the
number of such persons; but little was done except to take
still harsher measures against a more or less inoffensive people
from Asia (§ <a href='#s603'>603</a>). In 1885 twenty-seven Chinamen were murdered
by miners in Wyoming because they refused to join in a
strike. As the Chinese could not vote, nobody seemed afraid
to favor a measure for their exclusion. In 1888, therefore,
a more stringent law was passed prohibiting their immigration
into the country. It was not very perfectly drawn, however,
and was easily evaded by immigration through Canada and in
other ways.<a id='r288'/><a href='#f288' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[288]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s625'></a><span class='bold'>625. The Chicago Anarchists.</span>—Unmistakable evidences of
discontent among the laboring classes continued to alarm the
country. Various organizations of workmen were formed, the
most conspicuous of which was the “Knights of Labor,” with
upwards of a million members. A great strike took place in
St. Louis in the Spring of 1886, but the most violent outbreak
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span>
occurred in Chicago, May 4, 1886. A riot of anarchists, mostly
foreigners, resulted in the killing of a number of policemen by
bombs thrown in Haymarket Square. Four leading rioters
were executed. Others were imprisoned, but were pardoned
in 1893 by Governor Altgeld of Illinois. Though a reaction
immediately took place against violence of an anarchistic
kind, discontent throughout the country went on increasing.
Perhaps the lessons taught by the Chicago tragedy were best
taken to heart by those philanthropists who began establishing
“settlements” among the poor of the great cities and in other
ways labored to improve their condition.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s626'></a><span class='bold'>626. Pension Vetoes.</span>—Both political parties had been inclined
to pursue a liberal policy in regard to military pensions.
The debt of gratitude to the old soldiers and sailors was so
generally felt that whenever a proposition to extend the pension
list was made, very few politicians seemed willing to
oppose it. The consequence was, that the liberality of Congress
seemed to many persons, including the President, to be
running into folly and extravagance. The pension list was
costing the Treasury about one hundred million dollars a year,
and Cleveland determined to resist its increase. He vetoed so
large a number of pension bills, including a specially liberal
one known as the Dependent Pension Bill (1887), that efforts
to extend the lists were discouraged.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s627'></a><span class='bold'>627. Accumulation in the Treasury.</span>—In the course of
Cleveland’s administration the silver coined under the Bland-Allison
law (§ <a href='#s604'>604</a>) was but slightly circulated, and the income
of the government from tariff and internal revenue largely
exceeded the expenses. All the bonds that were due had been
paid, and the interest on the national debt had been greatly
reduced. In consequence there was an accumulation of a very
large sum of money in the Treasury. The President was
strongly of the opinion that financial distress would result
from continuance of a tariff producing a surplus that kept
so much money from circulation and tempted congressmen to
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
make large appropriations for pensions and for less worthy
objects. Accordingly, in a special message of December, 1887,
he recommended a policy of tariff reform in the interests of
freer trade. As the Senate was still Republican, he could not
have hoped that Congress would at once pass such a measure
as he recommended and as the House agreed to when it passed
a reduced tariff act, known as the “Mills Bill,” from its chief
framer, Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Cleveland’s message was
designed to place the matter before the country in such a way
that it would become the main issue at the next Presidential
election. In this purpose he was successful, although the
“Mills Bill” failed in the Senate.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s628'></a><span class='bold'>628. Election of Harrison and Morton.</span>—The Republicans at
their convention held at Chicago in 1888, nominated, for President,
Benjamin Harrison<a id='r289'/><a href='#f289' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[289]</span></sup></a> of Indiana, a grandson of President
William Henry Harrison, and for Vice President, Levi P.
Morton of New York. The Democrats met at St. Louis and
renominated Cleveland, who was strong with the masses of
the party, although unpopular with the politicians. Allen G.
Thurman, formerly senator from Ohio, was nominated for Vice
President. At the end of a vigorous campaign, conducted
almost exclusively on the tariff issue, but marked by the circulation
of misleading statements and the corrupt use of money,<a id='r290'/><a href='#f290' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[290]</span></sup></a>
Harrison had two hundred and thirty-three electoral votes, and

That the North and South were forgetting their differences was proved
during Cleveland’s administration in two striking ways. In 1885 ex-Confederate
generals attended Grant’s funeral; the next year, the sufferings of the
people of Charleston, South Carolina, on account of the earthquake that so
damaged the city, called forth great sympathy and help from the people of the
North and West.</p>

There was a large amount of money raised and used by the Republicans
for campaign purposes, and it was charged by the Democrats that much of
this fund was employed in purchasing votes, especially in Indiana. Counter
charges of a similar nature were brought against the Democrats; and it is
clear that the people at large believed the election to have been a discreditable
one to both parties, since the adoption of better ballot laws by the states was
accelerated (§ <a href='#s621'>621</a>).</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br/> <span class='bold'><span class='sc'>the administration of benjamin harrison, 1889–1893.</span></span></h2>

<h3 id='s629a'><span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>DOMESTIC EVENTS AND MEASURES.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s629'></a><span class='bold'>629. Character of Harrison’s Administration.</span>—President
Harrison was an able lawyer and a good judge of men, as he
proved by important judicial appointments and by the choice
of a strong Cabinet. His Secretary of State was J. G. Blaine.
Since the latter had favored a rather aggressive foreign policy,
it is not strange that Harrison’s administration should be important
on account of international relations. Since Congress
was Republican in both branches when the administration
began, it was possible to carry through important domestic
legislation, including a new tariff and a lavish pension bill.
One measure on which many Republicans had set their hearts,—a
Federal Election Bill, introduced by Congressman (later
Senator) Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the object of
which was to enable the general government to prevent fraud
at elections in the larger cities and in the South,—was finally
defeated in the Senate by a combination of Democrats and
Republicans favoring more liberal laws with regard to silver.
The defeat of this so-called “Force Bill” was probably good
for the country and not harmful to the Republicans; but the
party was hurt by its tariff legislation and was badly defeated
in the congressional election of 1890. Thus the second half
of Harrison’s administration was not so productive of important
legislation as the first. The Union was enlarged during this
period by the addition of six of the far Western states. North
and South Dakota, Montana, and Washington were admitted
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>
in 1889, and Idaho and Wyoming in 1890. In the more than
twenty years that had elapsed since the admission of Nebraska
in 1867, only one state had been admitted—Colorado, in 1876.
At the end of Harrison’s administration, the question of securing
for the Union territory outside its bounds—to wit, the
Hawaiian Islands—became important (§ <a href='#s650'>650</a>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s630'></a><span class='bold'>630. The McKinley Tariff.</span>—The election of Harrison had
turned chiefly on the tariff issue raised by the special message
of Cleveland; and
as the nation had
decided against
the Cleveland doctrine,
the framing
of a new tariff bill
was early undertaken.
It was, as
usual, intrusted to
the House Committee
of Ways
and Means, of
which William
McKinley of Ohio
was chairman.
While it was generally
felt that a
large part of the
surplus in the
Treasury ought to
be put into circulation,
the Republicans were unwilling to reduce the duties on
protected goods. Therefore they adopted the policy of imposing
a higher duty on all articles produced in the United States,
and reducing the duty on all other articles. It was believed
that in this way the excess of revenue could be checked without
endangering the protective system. As a matter of fact,
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span>
the so-called “McKinley Tariff” of 1890, although it admitted
sugar free, and was supplemented in the Senate by a “reciprocity
clause,” which authorized the President to modify the
tariff rates upon goods from other nations according to the
liberality of those nations toward goods from the United
States, created great popular disturbance, and converted many
voters to Cleveland’s theories of freer trade. It was followed
by a marked rise of prices in certain articles, and this fact
probably contributed largely to the crushing defeat of the
Republicans in the election of 1890.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s631'></a><span class='bold'>631. Oklahoma Territory.</span>—The new tariff, although it attracted
so much attention, was but one of several important
features of Harrison’s administration. Not long after the
inauguration, the territory of Oklahoma was thrown open for
settlement. It had formed a part of Indian Territory, but the
right of the Indians had been purchased by the United States.
In order to prevent speculation, Harrison made it known that
no entrance into the territory before noon of April 22, 1889,
would entitle any one to preëmpt land. As the soil and climate
were considered particularly desirable, a vast crowd, numbering,
it was said, as many as fifty thousand people, gathered on
the border to be among the first settlers. At the bugle blast
announcing the hour, the waiting settlers rushed over the border
and the scramble of selecting lands began. Within a few
months Guthrie, the capital, had several thousand inhabitants,
with banks, schools, churches, and electric lights. The same
year that witnessed this notable evidence of national enterprise
also saw the great flood of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which
destroyed many lives and much property.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s632'></a><span class='bold'>632. The Pan-American Congress.</span>—In October, 1889, as a result
of the work of a commission appointed in 1884, a congress
of representatives of eighteen of the leading governments of
North, Central, and South America, met at Washington, in
what was known as the Pan-American Congress. The meeting,
which had been advocated by Blaine, was designed to promote
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>
facilities for commercial intercourse. After visiting various
parts of the United States, the delegates, sixty-six in number,
returned to Washington and devoted several months to the discussion
of better methods of making the resources of their
respective countries known, and to other subjects of mutual
interest. The conference was not wholly harmonious, nor were
the results very definite, although the fact was brought out
that Blaine and other Republicans were modifying their views
in the direction of more liberal opinions with regard to the
value to the country of less restricted foreign trade.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s633'></a><span class='bold'>633. New Rules in the House of Representatives.</span>—In December,
1889, important action was taken in the House of Representatives
to prevent the obstruction of business. Before that
time, the question as to whether a quorum was present was
determined by the number of members who responded to their
names at roll call, and any member felt at liberty to remain
silent when his name was called. This custom afforded many
opportunities for the minority to prevent legislation by simply
remaining silent, and thus reducing the number apparently
present to less than a quorum. It was also possible to obstruct
legislation indefinitely by a succession of motions requiring a
call of the roll. The Republican majority, under the leadership
of Speaker Thomas B. Reed of Maine, now changed the
rules so that a quorum would be determined by the number of
those actually present. The new rules also empowered the
Speaker to ignore motions which he regarded as purely dilatory.
Mr. Reed’s innovations were denounced at the time as
tyrannical, and he became popularly known as “Czar Reed”;
but the general wisdom of his course of action was acknowledged
later, especially when the Democrats, on obtaining control
of the House in 1891, did not revert to the old rules.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s634'></a><span class='bold'>634. Silver Legislation.</span>—The continued decline in the price
of silver had led to an active agitation in favor of a law to
require the government to coin all the silver that might be
brought to its mints at the rate of 371¼ grains of pure silver to
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>
the dollar (§ <a href='#s604'>604</a>). Such a law, it was argued, would not only
provide a market for the product of all the silver mines, but
would also raise the price of silver as compared with gold to
its old standard. A majority of the economists and financiers
of the country argued, however, that such an extension of the
currency would be sure to bring on a financial crisis.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s635'></a><span class='bold'>635. The Sherman Law.</span>—In order to prevent the passage of
the suggested law, Congress agreed, in 1890, upon a compromise
measure, proposed by Senator Sherman of Ohio. This
“Sherman Bill” provided that the government should buy
each month four and a half million ounces of silver, and
that, for the silver so purchased, the United States should
issue Treasury notes. These notes, known as silver certificates,
were to be legal tender in payment of debt. This compromise
increased the amount of currency in circulation by about fifty-four
million dollars a year, and proved to be a severe drain
upon the Treasury and a cause of financial uneasiness. It did
not, however, raise the price of silver, as many had anticipated
(§ <a href='#s647'>647</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s636'></a><span class='bold'>636. New Pensions.</span>—The vast sum accumulated in the
Treasury and the rapid increase of the currency stimulated
large expenditures on the part of the government. The President
recommended greater liberality in the granting of pensions,
and the “Dependent Pension Bill” was finally passed
in 1890 (§ <a href='#s626'>626</a>). Under this law the amount annually expended
for pensions rapidly rose until, in the course of a few
years, it reached more than one hundred and fifty million
dollars a year.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s637'></a><span class='bold'>637. Internal Improvements.</span>—Congress also made large
appropriations for internal improvements; increased the appropriations
for the navy; and voted to refund to the individual
states the amount of taxes they had levied in support of
the war for the Union. In these ways, the expenditures
of the Fifty-first Congress exceeded those of the Fiftieth by
about one hundred and seventy million dollars, and in consequence
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
the former body came to be popularly known as the
“Billion Dollar Congress.” This fact gave the Democrats a
good opportunity to charge the Republicans with gross extravagance,
and contributed to the defeat of the latter in the elections
of 1890.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s638'></a><span class='bold'>638. Labor Riots.</span>—Harrison’s administration, like those of
his immediate predecessors, was marked by industrial disturbances.
In the summer of 1892, a great strike occurred
at Homestead, near Pittsburg, among the employees of the
Carnegie Steel Company. In order to protect the works and
the non-union workmen, a considerable number of Pinkerton
detectives were employed by the owners. A collision occurred
between the detectives and the strikers, in which the former
were forced to surrender, seven detectives and eleven strikers
being killed. The district was placed under martial law, and
the militia of the state had to be called out before order could
be restored. About the same time, disturbances also occurred
at Buffalo, New York, as well as in Tennessee, where the custom
of hiring out convict laborers caused considerable rioting,
which had to be put down by the troops.</p>

<h3 id='s639a'>FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s639'></a><span class='bold'>639. Difficulty with Italy.</span>—During Harrison’s administration,
the foreign relations of the government required, as has
already been indicated, very careful treatment. In March,
1891, a serious riot occurred in New Orleans, in which several
persons of Italian birth were forcibly taken from jail by a mob
and shot or hanged. The disturbance was due to the murder
of a popular chief of police and to the unexpected acquittal of
six of the Italians accused of the crime and the failure of the
jury to agree on a verdict in the case of three. Believing
that the jury was bribed or intimidated by the criminal secret
society known as the “Mafia,” to which the accused men belonged,
the citizens became infuriated and broke into the jail,
under the leadership of the district attorney. Most of the men
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>
lynched were naturalized citizens, but some of them still owed
allegiance to Italy. While the United States government expressed
its earnest regret at the incident, it disavowed all
responsibility for it, since it was a matter entirely under the
control of the State of Louisiana. The Italian government
demanded a national apology, the payment of an indemnity,
and the punishment of the perpetrators of the outrage. The
United States government refused to comply; whereupon the
Italian minister withdrew from Washington. The matter assumed
a warlike aspect; but as an evidence of national good
will the government finally agreed to pay the sum of twenty-five
thousand dollars for the families of those who had been
killed. Blaine managed the negotiations in a most creditable
manner, in view of the difficulty of making the Italian government
understand that even in affairs involving international
relations the government of the United States sometimes has
not full control of the actions of its own citizens.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s640'></a><span class='bold'>640. Difficulty with Chile.</span>—In October, 1891, a number of
sailors in uniform, belonging to the United States cruiser <span class='it'>Baltimore</span>,
were assaulted in the streets of Valparaiso, in consequence
of bad feeling aroused by previous acts of the American
Minister, who had not been neutral in a civil war going on in
Chile. The Chilean populace was also incensed against the
Americans on account of the illegal chase of a Chilean vessel,
the <span class='it'>Itata</span>, by the United States cruiser <span class='it'>Charleston</span>. The requests
of our government for an apology and for reparation
were ignored, until, in January, 1892, a peremptory demand,
accompanied by ships of war, was presented to the Chilean
government. An indemnity of seventy-five thousand dollars
was promptly offered and accepted. Blaine seems to have
handled with his usual skill this not altogether creditable
affair.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s641'></a><span class='bold'>641. Seal Fisheries.</span>—Blaine displayed equal vigor, but probably
less discretion, in his efforts to secure the settlement of
another serious question. For some years a dispute had existed
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>
between Great Britain and the United States, in regard to the
rights of vessels engaged in the seal fisheries off Alaska.<a id='r291'/><a href='#f291' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[291]</span></sup></a> The
dispute involved the question as to whether Alaska seals, in
going to and from the outer islands, passed out of the United
States jurisdiction, so as to be subject to capture by foreign
fishermen. This difficult question, which had never been
clearly settled by international law, was finally submitted, in
1892, to arbitration, the seven arbitrators meeting at Paris, in
the spring of 1893. The contention of the United States was
not allowed, and it was declared that no exclusive property in
seals could exist outside the three-mile limit. It was decided,
however, that both nations might join in protecting the seals in
the open waters.</p>

<h3 id='s642a'>POLITICAL AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s642'></a><span class='bold'>642. The People’s Party.</span>—For many years before 1890 the
farmers of the country had shown unmistakable signs of dissatisfaction
(§ <a href='#s596'>596</a>). Many organizations, known as Farmers’
Leagues, Granges, Patrons of Industry, and Farmers’ Alliances,
had been organized for various purposes, and for the spread of
knowledge in regard to matters of mutual interest. In 1889
these organizations were united into what was known as the
“Farmers’ Alliance and Industrial Union.” They met in St.
Louis, and in the following year called a convention, which
gave to the organization the title of the “People’s [or Populist]
Party.” They demanded the unlimited coinage of silver, at a
ratio of sixteen to one (§ <a href='#s604'>604</a>), a graduated income tax, government
ownership of railroads and telegraphs, and a national currency
to be loaned to the people, at two per cent, on the security
of land or produce. On this platform, in 1890, two senators
and five representatives in Congress were elected. In 1892 the
new party was ready to put a Presidential ticket in the field.
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s643'></a><span class='bold'>643. Pending Political Questions.</span>—In the election of 1892
several very important questions were involved. While there
had been general prosperity in the country, there was a widespread
feeling that the tariff was not accomplishing what had
been claimed for it. The government was accused of great
extravagance (§ <a href='#s637'>637</a>), and some of its creditable achievements,
such as the passage of a long needed International Copyright
Law and of an Anti-Lottery Bill which helped to put down
the great Louisiana Lottery, were hardly remembered. The
relations of capital and labor were not satisfactory, and it was
widely felt that labor was not receiving its share in the profits
of industry. The accumulations of silver in the Treasury now
amounted to a vast sum, which many people desired to see put
in circulation. In the midst of this prevailing discontent,
Harrison, who had been a good executive, was renominated
for the Presidency, with Whitelaw Reid of New York for Vice
President, in a convention held at Minneapolis. The Democrats
met at Chicago, and once more nominated Cleveland, who
had spent the interim practicing law in New York City, with
Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois for Vice President. The People’s
Party nominated James B. Weaver of Iowa for President, and
James G. Field of Virginia for Vice President. The result was
an overwhelming victory for the Democrats. Cleveland and
Stevenson received two hundred and seventy-seven electoral
votes, while Harrison and Reid received only one hundred and
forty-five, and the People’s Party candidates, twenty-two.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br/> <span class='bold'><span class='sc'>second administration of cleveland, 1893–1897.</span></span></h2>

<h3 id='s644a'><span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s644'></a><span class='bold'>644. Character of the Administration.</span>—Although Cleveland
began his second administration with a Democratic majority in
both houses of Congress,—something that had not been known
since the outbreak of the war,—he was not able, for two reasons,
to make as successful a record as he had made during his first
term. The pension, tariff, and monetary legislation of Harrison’s
administration brought about great financial disturbances,
which lost the Democrats the control of the House of Representatives
and hampered Cleveland; while the latter’s own
party, the Democrats, broke away from his leadership and
adopted many of the extreme, more or less socialistic views of
the People’s Party. Cleveland himself, although he increased
the number of offices subject to Civil Service rules and made
good appointments, failed to maintain tactful relations with
the Democratic leaders and even lost some of his hold upon
the people at large. Nevertheless, he administered his duties
with such firmness and honesty that it would be unjust to
describe his second administration as a failure.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s645'></a><span class='bold'>645. Industrial Causes of the Panic of 1893.</span>—On taking up
his duties, the new President found himself confronted with a
serious financial crisis. The prospect of change in the tariff
and in the currency had unsettled financial and commercial
activity. The manufacturers of the country relied on the aid
of high protective duties, but the Democratic victory had been
so sweeping that they feared the tariff would be either greatly
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>
modified or swept away. They argued that in this case the
country would be flooded with foreign articles, and that prices
would be so reduced as to bring disaster to all who had
domestic goods on hand. As soon, therefore, as it seemed probable
that the Democrats would carry the election, manufacturers
very generally suspended operations in their shops, and
thousands of workmen were thrown out of employment. From
this cause there was an immediate stagnation of business, which
helped to bring on financial distress.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s646'></a><span class='bold'>646. Financial Causes of the Panic.</span>—There was another cause
of business depression, which is more difficult to explain, but
which had a still more disastrous influence. The greenbacks
not redeemed in 1879 (§ <a href='#s605'>605</a>), but still subject to redemption,
amounted to more than $346,000,000. The Silver Purchase Act
of 1890, as we have already seen (§ <a href='#s635'>635</a>), directed the Treasurer
to buy silver bullion at the rate of $4,500,000 a month and pay
for it with new notes that were “exchangeable for coin.” Now
the government interpreted “coin” to mean gold. In this
way the notes in circulation redeemable in gold increased, till,
in 1893, they amounted to nearly $500,000,000. As the number
was constantly increasing at the rate of $4,500,000 a month,
the people began to distrust the ability of the government to
redeem the notes. This distrust of itself would have made a
financial crash inevitable, but the condition was made worse
by the decline in the price of silver, to which reference has
several times been made (§ <a href='#s634'>634</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s647'></a><span class='bold'>647. Decline in the Price of Silver.</span>—In twenty years the
value of silver had fallen from one dollar and thirty cents
an ounce, till in 1893 it was worth only about eighty cents.
People in Europe, as well as in America, naturally feared
that our government might interpret the word “coin” to
mean silver as well as gold, and might choose to redeem its
notes in the cheaper metal. This fear led business men everywhere
to desire the redemption of their bonds and notes before
the government should begin to pay silver. Foreign investors
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span>
sent back their bonds for redemption, while the people at home
in many cases even drew their money from banks through fear
that the latter would soon not be able to meet the demands
for gold made upon them. These various influences caused
a financial crash about two months after Cleveland’s inauguration.
More than three hundred banks either failed outright
or suspended payment; business men found it impossible to
borrow money on any terms, and thousands of failures in business
followed.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s648'></a><span class='bold'>648. Repeal of the Sherman Act.</span>—As the Treasury was still
obliged by the Sherman Act to continue purchasing silver, the
President called a special session of Congress to modify or
repeal the law. The clause of the bill authorizing the purchase
of silver was quickly repealed by the House, when Congress
met in August, but the measure was strenuously opposed
in the Senate by numerous advocates of the unrestricted use
of silver currency. The repealing act was finally carried and
became a law, November 1, 1893. Its remedial effects, however,
were not speedily visible. At the beginning of winter it
was estimated that as many as two hundred and sixty thousand
laboring men were unoccupied in Chicago, New York, and
Philadelphia. Moreover, the repeal of the Sherman Act and
the persistent decline in the price of silver caused nearly
all the silver mines in the West to be closed. In Colorado
alone, from fifteen to twenty thousand miners not only lost
their employment, but became dependent on charity for food
and shelter. The demand for free coinage of silver at the rate
of sixteen to one consequently became emphatic in the far West
and was supported by the Populists and many Democrats in
the East.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s649'></a><span class='bold'>649. The Wilson Tariff Law.</span>—As the Democrats were
pledged to modify the tariff law, this subject was taken up at
the beginning of the first regular session of Congress in December,
1893. William L. Wilson of West Virginia, Chairman of
the House Committee on Ways and Means, brought in a bill
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span>
which greatly reduced the tariff on many articles. This measure,
after being much altered on account of opposition in the
Senate, was finally passed. The President, however, since
the bill in its ultimate form reduced duties only about one
quarter on an average, regarded it as a modification of a
protective tariff, rather than as a measure in the interests of
freer trade, and therefore allowed it to become a law without
his approval or signature. It was anticipated that the law
would fail to produce the necessary revenue, and, largely on
this account, a clause was added which provided for an income
tax of two per cent on all incomes of more than four thousand
dollars. It was expected that the income tax would yield not
less than forty million dollars a year. The Supreme Court,
however, declared this portion of the act unconstitutional
and therefore null and void. The natural consequences followed.
The income of the government was insufficient to
meet the current expenses; gold continued to be exported for
the payment of bonds offered for redemption. To meet these
demands new bonds had to be issued; and consequently, before
the end of the administration, the public debt had been increased
by about two hundred and fifty million dollars. It is
no wonder, in view of the unsatisfactory character of the
Democratic legislation in 1893–1894, that in the congressional
elections of 1894 the Republicans should have swept the
country.</p>

<h3 id='s650a'>FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s650'></a><span class='bold'>650. Revolution in Hawaii.</span>—Early in his administration,
President Cleveland was obliged to consider the condition of
affairs in Hawaii. While Harrison was in office, discontented
resident Americans and Sandwich Islanders had overthrown
the government of Queen Liliuokalani and established a republican
form of government. The leaders hoped that they could
secure the annexation of the Islands to the United States.
American seamen were landed for the avowed purpose of
protecting American citizens, but it was charged, with probable
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
truthfulness, that they actively supported the revolutionary
movement. The insurgents sent commissioners to Washington,
who were influential enough to secure the draft of a treaty of
annexation, which was sent by Harrison to the Senate for confirmation.
Before the Senate was ready to act on the treaty,
however, Harrison’s administration came to an end; and one of
Cleveland’s first acts was to withdraw the treaty and send a
commissioner to the Islands to investigate and report on the
condition of affairs. On his arrival the commissioner declared
the previously established American protectorate at an end and
took down the American flag. In his final report to the President,
he asserted that the success of the revolution had resulted
chiefly from the efforts of the American Minister and the support
of the American troops. The President thereupon withdrew
all such support and wrote a letter of regret and sympathy
to the queen. He also sent a minister to help her to regain her
authority,—an act for which he was much criticised by the
many persons who disapproved of his Hawaiian policy. The
movement on the Islands, however, had been so successful that
the queen was unable to regain her throne and finally sold her
rights. The annexationists were completely successful four
years later (§ <a href='#s672'>672</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s651'></a><span class='bold'>651. The Venezuelan Dispute.</span>—Two years later, President
Cleveland proved to the critics of his Hawaiian policy that he
had a firmer grasp on foreign affairs than they thought. For
nearly half a century a difference of opinion had existed between
Great Britain and Venezuela as to the boundary line
between their possessions in South America. Great Britain
had received by treaty, nearly a hundred years before, the
territory in South America which belonged to Holland; while
the rights of Venezuela had been derived from Spain. The
boundary line had never been clearly defined, and, as time
progressed, disputes with regard to it became more and more
serious. Venezuela finally appealed to the United States for
assistance. President Cleveland’s Secretary of State, Richard
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>
Olney of Massachusetts, entered into correspondence with the
British government for the purpose of securing a settlement of
the dispute by arbitration. Great Britain took the ground that
the question was one not appropriate for arbitration, inasmuch
as it involved the possible surrender of territory which had long
been believed to be British and had been occupied by British
subjects, whose rights should not be put in jeopardy. The
correspondence became animated, and finally, in December,
1895, President Cleveland submitted the papers to Congress
with a special message. He took the ground that the United
States, following out the Monroe Doctrine, would be bound to
resist in every possible way any encroachment by Great Britain
upon any territory belonging to Venezuela. He asked for an
appropriation by Congress to provide for a commission to investigate
the whole subject of the boundary dispute. Congress
at once appropriated one hundred thousand dollars for that
purpose. The message of the President startled every one and
made a profound sensation, not only in the United States, but
also in Great Britain and in other parts of Europe. The
possibility, even the probability, of war was freely talked of,<a id='r292'/><a href='#f292' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[292]</span></sup></a>
although the people of neither country desired it. The commission
entered promptly upon its work, but before it was ready to
report, the British government agreed to submit to arbitration
all questions pertaining to lands other than those that could be
shown, before a joint commission, to have been occupied by
British subjects for at least fifty years. In this way the contentions
of both governments were satisfied. The joint commission
of arbitration met in Paris in the summer of 1899, and
in due form rendered a final judgment, which was on the whole
favorable to Great Britain. Cleveland’s action in the matter,
while harshly criticised in some quarters, especially on account
of the direct language employed in his message, was on the
whole supported with great enthusiasm by the people at large,
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>
regardless of party. The policy he advocated with respect to
the relations of the United States toward the weaker republics
to the south may be regarded as an extension of the Monroe
Doctrine, to which Congress and the people have given their
consent.</p>

<h3 id='s652a'>DOMESTIC EVENTS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s652'></a><span class='bold'>652. The World’s Columbian Exposition.</span>—One of the most
conspicuous events of Cleveland’s second administration was the
Columbian Exposition, commemorative of the four hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus. There
was active competition among the great cities for the privilege of
holding the exhibition. Congress decided upon Chicago. The
exposition was projected for the year 1892, but the preparations
to be made were so vast that postponement till 1893
was necessary. A large appropriation was made by Congress,
and the state of Illinois also rendered important assistance;
but the remarkable success of the undertaking was chiefly due
to the enterprise of the people of Chicago. No other exhibition
ever presented so magnificent an appearance. Jackson
Park, on the shore of Lake Michigan, was chosen as a site,
and the preparation of grounds and buildings was intrusted
to a board of the most eminent landscape gardeners and
architects in the country. Machinery and manufactured products
were brought together from all lands, and an important
impulse was given to every form of American and European
industry. But while the exhibits were most satisfactory, the
beauty of the grounds and buildings was more important, since
it encouraged the belief that America could become in time
as notable for her artistic as for her industrial achievements.
The exposition was visited by more than twenty-seven millions
of people—nearly three times as many as visited the Centennial
at Philadelphia in 1876 (§ <a href='#s595'>595</a>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s653'></a><span class='bold'>653. Strikes and Riots.</span>—The Columbian Exposition represented
the benefits of industrial peace; but while it was being
held, the panic already described (§§ <a href='#s645'>645</a>-<a href='#s649'>649</a>) was in progress,
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
and the country’s industries were thrown into great confusion.
As had so often happened in the twenty years preceding, discontent
among the working classes caused much agitation and
rioting. An “army” of unemployed men and tramps, under
the leadership of a person named Coxey, actually marched to
Washington to demand redress for their grievances. They
were easily dispersed; but a great strike, which took place at
Chicago in the summer of 1894, was put down only with the use
of considerable force. General inactivity in business had led
the Pullman Car Company to make a reduction in the price
of labor in their shops. The strike just mentioned followed;
and, after some weeks of turbulence, the American Railway
Union ordered the employees of all those railroads in Chicago
that did not refuse to use the Pullman cars to cease work. The
consequence was a practical cessation of traffic for some days.
When an attempt was made to move the trains, the trainmen
were assaulted. Cars were wrecked and set on fire, and many
men were killed or wounded. President Cleveland, though
having no precedent for the act, with characteristic energy
and decision sent United States troops to protect United States
property, to secure the unhindered transmission of the mails,
and to prevent interference with interstate commerce. His
firmness restored order in Chicago and prevented outbreaks of
lawlessness in other places.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s654'></a><span class='bold'>654. The Political Condition of New York City.</span>—The city of
New York had long been disgracefully ruled by corrupt politicians
affiliated with Tammany Hall. In 1894, an investigating
committee exposed the system of blackmail and plunder
by which the politicians maintained themselves in power.
In consequence of these revelations, a reform ticket was
victorious in the fall of 1894 and the government of the
city was improved.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s655'></a><span class='bold'>655. The Campaign of 1896.</span>—Political conditions at the
time of the campaign of 1896 were strangely confused. The
President and his supporters were out of sympathy with
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>
the chief leaders and the masses of the Democratic party.
Many Democrats had become Populists. Many Republicans
who favored silver had broken more or less with those of their
party who considered the protective tariff the main political
issue. The number of Independent voters had increased. In
the midst of this confusion, the Republican convention met at
St. Louis and adopted a platform favoring protection and, less
explicitly, the maintenance of a gold standard. They also
declared their willingness to coöperate with European nations
in an effort to restore a policy of bimetalism. The Democrats,
on the other hand, meeting at Chicago, declared that the United
States should adopt the free coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen
to one, even without the coöperation of Europe. Other
planks, especially one attacking the Supreme Court, which had
given offense by its decision with regard to the income tax (§ <a href='#s649'>649</a>),
showed that the party had adopted many of the principles of
the Populists. The administration of Cleveland was expressly
condemned. The Republicans, rejecting the candidacy of
Speaker Reed, nominated, for President, William McKinley,<a id='r293'/><a href='#f293' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[293]</span></sup></a>
who had left Congress to become governor of Ohio, and had
secured the shrewd support of Marcus A. Hanna of that state.
Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey was nominated for Vice
President. The Democrats, carried away by a remarkable
speech of William J. Bryan,<a id='r294'/><a href='#f294' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[294]</span></sup></a> a young ex-congressman from
Nebraska, nominated him for President, and Arthur Sewall of
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span>
Maine for Vice President. Bryan’s nomination was accepted
by the “People’s” Party, but Thomas E. Watson of Georgia
was put in place of Sewall for
Vice President. Those Democrats
that could not advocate
a free coinage policy, after much
hesitation, met in separate convention
at Indianapolis and
nominated General John M.
Palmer of Illinois for President,
and General Simon B. Buckner
of Kentucky for Vice President,
on a platform advocating a gold
basis. The campaign was an
exciting one and caused much
anxiety in financial circles; but
it was conducted with unusual
freedom from personal accusations.
Bryan made a remarkable
tour of the country, stirring large crowds by his eloquence;
but his efforts were vain, since the silver policy he supported
drove thousands of Democrats and Independents into the Republican
ranks. McKinley and Hobart were elected by two
hundred and seventy-one electoral votes, while Bryan and
Sewall received one hundred and seventy-six. So great was
the disaffection within the Democratic party, that the “Solid
South” was broken for the first time since the war.</p>

<h3 id='s656a'><span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span>THE BEGINNING OF McKINLEY’S ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s656'></a><span class='bold'>656. Character of the Administration.</span>—McKinley soon proved
himself to possess great tact as an executive. Some of his
Cabinet appointments were not good, and he showed weakness
in his attitude toward Civil Service reform; but as time went
on his courtesy and amiability won him many friends, even
among his political opponents. His administration was strong
through the presence of a Republican majority in both houses
of Congress, and important tariff and other legislation was
made possible. But before long domestic affairs were overshadowed
by issues growing out of the war with Spain and the
acquisition of outlying territories.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s657'></a><span class='bold'>657. Modification of the Tariff.</span>—Two days after McKinley’s
inauguration he summoned an extra session of Congress, and
in his message called attention to the fact that for some years
the expenditures of the government had exceeded the income,
and that the tariff should be so modified as to remedy this
deficiency. A tariff bill was soon presented by Representative
Dingley, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the
House, and was duly passed. It increased duties markedly,
but to a less extent than the McKinley Bill. For many months
the Dingley Bill failed to furnish the needed additional revenue,
and to supply the deficiency, the bill was supplemented by an
additional tax on beer and a few other articles. The questions
with regard to the currency and to banking which the
party platform had promised to settle were reserved for later
Congressional action.

<h3 id='s658a'>THE WAR WITH SPAIN.</h3>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>William McKinley.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s658'></a><span class='bold'>658. Early Spanish Difficulties in Cuba.</span>—Spanish rule in the
West Indies had, ever since the discovery of America, been
characterized by rapacity and cruelty. Revolts were never
uncommon; but outbreaks were particularly frequent during
the latter part
of the nineteenth
century.
As many as
eight organized
efforts to throw
off the Spanish
yoke occurred
between 1823
and the “Ten
Years’ War,”
which desolated
Cuba from 1868
to 1878. Instead
of taking
a lesson from
experience, and
improving the
condition of affairs,
the Spanish
authorities
doubled the discontent
by the
imposition of taxes designed to reimburse the mother country
for the cost of the long war. The result was a rapid reorganization
of the Cuban forces and a fresh outbreak of revolt in
1895.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s659'></a><span class='bold'>659. Later Policy of Spain.</span>—The Spanish government now
adopted a harsher policy than ever. Captain-General Campos
was thought to be too lenient, and he was replaced by General
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span>
Weyler, who had gained notoriety for harshness as Governor-General
of the Philippines. The new governor took hold of
his work in Cuba with brutal energy. His policy was simply
to starve the people into submission. With a large army he
overran the island, burning houses and crops and driving the
women and children into villages and pens, called “trochas,”
where their numbers were rapidly reduced by starvation.
President Cleveland attempted to intercede in behalf of the
Cubans, but his approaches were repelled by the government
at Madrid as an unwarranted interference, and nothing was
accomplished.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s660'></a><span class='bold'>660. Sympathies of Americans.</span>—As the Cuban situation
came to be more thoroughly understood in the United States,
public opinion was outraged and finally raised to a high pitch of
indignation. Money and supplies were privately sent to assist
the insurgents, and the United States government was obliged
to police its ports in order to preserve the international obligations
of neutrality. The temper of the country and the
representations of our government soon convinced Spain that
concessions must be made or immediate war was inevitable.
Weyler was removed and a promise of some measure of self-government
was given. Notwithstanding these assurances,
however, there was little public faith in Spanish promises,
and no plain evidence of improvement followed.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s661'></a><span class='bold'>661. Destruction of the “Maine.”</span>—Such being the state of
affairs, war was rendered almost inevitable by a disastrous
event that took place on the 15th of February, 1898. The
United States battleship <span class='it'>Maine</span> was anchored in the harbor
of Havana. Late in the evening, after most of the crew had
gone to their hammocks, a terrific explosion occurred, which
destroyed not only the ship, but also the lives of two hundred
and sixty-six of the officers and crew. The horror of the
disaster thrilled the civilized world. A court consisting of
naval officers was appointed by the President to investigate
the matter and report. They employed divers, as well as
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span>
other experts, and reported that all the evidence tended to show
that a mine beneath the keel had exploded first and that the
concussion had an instant later exploded two of the magazines
of the vessel. A Spanish court denied the correctness of the
American report. There was no evidence whatever that any
mine had been exploded with the knowledge of the Spanish
authorities, and the captain-general and other officials disavowed
all knowledge of the cause of the disaster. The government
at Madrid, moreover, made haste to express its regrets
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s662'></a><span class='bold'>662. Outburst of Public Sentiment.</span>—When the report of the
investigation was made public, the people of the United States,
stimulated by the pulpit and the press, seemed to take the
matter into their own hands. Flags suddenly flew out from
public buildings and schoolhouses in all parts of the land. In
theaters and cafés audiences cheered and sprang to their
feet whenever the flag was displayed or the “Star Spangled
Banner” was sung. The nation throbbed with an indignant
enthusiasm. “Remember the Maine” was printed and shouted
everywhere. No such outburst of public feeling had been
seen since 1861; nor was it confined to any one section of
the country. The South was not behind the North and West
in demanding prompt action.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s663'></a><span class='bold'>663. Action of Congress and of the President.</span>—Members of
Congress, especially of the House of Representatives, were the
first to feel the significance of the public demand, and they
proceeded at once to urge decisive action upon the President.
President McKinley used the resources of diplomacy to induce
the Spanish government to withdraw from the island. They
made promises not fully credited or published,<a id='r295'/><a href='#f295' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[295]</span></sup></a> and on the 8th
of March, 1898, the President requested from Congress an appropriation
of fifty million dollars for national defense. The
appropriation was made without a dissenting vote. With this
sum coast fortifications were strengthened, vessels and naval
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span>
supplies were purchased in various parts of the world, and a
number of fast vessels were leased to form an auxiliary fleet.
On the 11th of April the President sent a special message to
Congress, in which he recited the practices of the Spanish
government in Cuba, and referred to the destruction of the
<span class='it'>Maine</span> as evidence of Spanish inability to restrain lawlessness
and misrule. His conclusion was, that forcible interference
would now be justified. Congress immediately responded,
and on the 19th of April, the anniversary of the battles of
Lexington and Concord, adopted resolutions declaring that
Cuba ought to be independent. This was practically a declaration
of war.<a id='r296'/><a href='#f296' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[296]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s664'></a><span class='bold'>664. Delay in the Opening of the War.</span>—The opening of the
war on land was delayed by the fact that the regular army was
small, and the fighting force had to be made up largely of volunteers.
During April and May the President called for two
hundred thousand men. The regular army was also increased
from twenty-seven thousand to sixty-two thousand. Besides
these, there were enlisted ten thousand immunes, or men who
had already had yellow fever, thirty-five hundred engineers, and
three thousand special cavalrymen, known as “Rough Riders,”
consisting largely of “cow-boys” and such others as had had
experience in daring horsemanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s665'></a><span class='bold'>665. General Character of the War.</span>—The war was a short one.
In advance it was popularly supposed that the Spanish navy
was somewhat stronger than the American. Accordingly,
there was not a little fear on the part of the cities along the
Northern coast. But as soon as hostilities began it was
found that the Spanish service was honeycombed with inefficiency
and corruption. On their war vessels nothing seemed
to be in good fighting order. Beyond the fact that the army
was equipped with Mauser rifles and smokeless powder, nothing
in the Spanish service seemed what it should be for the
vigorous prosecution of war. The consequence was, that on
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span>
land and on sea the American forces found victory comparatively
easy.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s666'></a><span class='bold'>666. The First Great Victory.</span>—At the outbreak of the war
the American Asiatic fleet, in command of Commodore George
Dewey,<a id='r297'/><a href='#f297' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[297]</span></sup></a> was stationed at Hong Kong. Under international
rules Dewey was obliged to withdraw
from that neutral port
within eight days. He received
orders from the President to proceed
to the Spanish archipelago of
the Philippines and capture or destroy
the Spanish fleet. Dewey
found the fleet in Manila Bay,
at daybreak of May 1, 1898, and
opened fire at once. The result
was a victory almost unique in
naval warfare. The Americans’
fire was terribly effective. It is
said that a single shot which exploded
in the Spanish flag-ship,
struck down the captain and sixty
men. The Spaniards fought with
great bravery, but finally lost ten war vessels and a transport.
On the American side not a man was killed and only eight
were slightly wounded.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s667'></a><span class='bold'>667. The Investment of Santiago.</span>—On the day after the
declaration of war, the President ordered the fleet at Key
<span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span>
West to sail at once to blockade the coast of Cuba. Preparations
for invasion were made with all possible rapidity; but it
was not until the 22d of June that the advance, under Major
General William R. Shafter,<a id='r298'/><a href='#f298' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[298]</span></sup></a>
landed for an attack upon
Santiago, the principal city
in the eastern part of the
island. On the 23d, a forward
movement was made
by the First and Tenth
Cavalry, and by the First
United States Volunteer
Cavalry, commonly known
as the “Rough Riders,”
under Colonel Leonard
Wood and Lieutenant
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt.
The lines were rapidly extended
toward the north
and west. On July 1, a
severe battle took place and the outworks of the city were
reached. El Caney and San Juan Hill were taken by storm,
after desperate charges and heavy losses. The investment of
the city was then practically complete.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s668'></a><span class='bold'>668. Admiral Cervera’s Movement.</span>—Before the outbreak of
the war, a Spanish squadron under Admiral Cervera assembled
at the Cape Verde Islands, and in April sailed for the Caribbean
Sea. Its destination was for some days in doubt, and an
attack on the New England coast was feared; but on the 19th
of May it secretly entered the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.
The North Atlantic Squadron, under Commodore William T.
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
Sampson,<a id='r299'/><a href='#f299' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[299]</span></sup></a> was searching for the enemy, and soon discovered
his hiding place.<a id='r300'/><a href='#f300' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[300]</span></sup></a> In order to prevent the Spanish army and
navy from concentrating their
forces at Santiago, attacks had
been made on several cities on
the coast of Cuba; but these
had produced no important results.
To prevent Cervera’s
escape, Lieutenant R. P. Hobson,
with seven volunteers, attempted,
early in the morning of
the 3d of June, by sinking the
coaling ship <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> under
the guns of the forts, to block
the narrow passage in the
mouth of Santiago harbor.
Though this exploit did not
accomplish what was hoped
for, owing to the fact that the
rudder of the <span class='it'>Merrimac</span> was shot away, it was perhaps the most
gallant and daring single exploit of the war. The members
of the party were showered with shot, but received no serious
wounds, and all were picked up by the Spaniards, Hobson
being helped into the launch by Admiral Cervera himself.
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s669'></a><span class='bold'>669. The Decisive Engagement of the War.</span>—The Spanish
government saw clearly that Cervera must either escape from
the harbor of Santiago, or be taken prisoner with all his ships.
Accordingly, the admiral was ordered to leave the harbor on the
first practicable opportunity. He chose the morning of Sunday,
July 3. The resulting battle was as remarkable as the
battle of Manila.<a id='r301'/><a href='#f301' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[301]</span></sup></a> In less than three hours all the Spanish
ships, besides the torpedo boats, were either destroyed or run
ashore. The Spanish admiral and thirteen hundred of his
men were taken prisoners, while about six hundred were either
killed or drowned. On the American side but one man was
killed and one man wounded. The capitulation of Santiago
and the entire eastern end of Cuba followed, the Spaniards
surrendering twenty-three thousand men,—a force considerably
larger than that of the besieging army. The work of the
navy was generally conceded to have been admirable; but the
conduct of the campaign on land was harshly criticised in
many quarters.

<p class='pindent'><a id='s670'></a><span class='bold'>670. Concluding Scenes of the War.</span>—General Nelson A.
Miles,<a id='r302'/><a href='#f302' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[302]</span></sup></a> with a force of about seventeen thousand men, landed
on the island of Porto
Rico (July 28), as soon
as it became known
that his troops would
not be needed at Santiago.
The Porto Ricans
offered very slight resistance,
and before the
middle of August the
island was in the possession
of the Americans.
Manila, the capital
city of the Philippine
Islands, was also
assaulted by the land
and naval forces, and
after a brief resistance
surrendered unconditionally,
on the 13th of
August. In every engagement
of the war,
the American soldiers
and sailors behaved
with great gallantry. But the management of affairs by the
War Department was, to say the least, unfortunate in many
respects. There was great confusion in the matter of furnishing
the troops with supplies, and the quality of the food provided
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span>
was in some instances so bad that influential officers had
to remonstrate against a condition of affairs that demoralized
the soldiers and exposed them to disease. Even in camps
situated within the United States, sickness and disorder were
common; and so loud an outcry was raised against official
mismanagement that the President appointed a commission to
investigate the matter. The commission, in its report, was
unexpectedly, and many thought unduly, favorable to the
War Department.</p>

<h3 id='s671a'>CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s671'></a><span class='bold'>671. The Treaty of Peace.</span>—On the 26th of July, the
Spanish government made overtures for peace. After various
delays, a preliminary agreement, or protocol, was signed,
August 12. President McKinley at once issued a proclamation,
suspending hostilities. It was agreed: (1) that Spain
should withdraw its troops from Cuba and renounce its authority
over that island; (2) that it should cede the island of Porto
Rico to the United States; (3) that it should transfer to the
United States one of the Caroline Islands; and (4) that the
future of the Philippine Islands should be determined by a joint
commission of the two powers appointed to arrange the details
of the treaty. According to the provisions of this protocol,
the joint commission met in Paris, on the 1st of October, 1898,
and, after long discussion of different points, signed the final
treaty on the 10th of December, 1898. This was ratified by the
United States on the 6th of February, and by Spain on the
17th of March, 1899. By the terms of the treaty, the United
States assumed a protectorate over Cuba; came into complete
possession of Porto Rico; received all right and title to the
Philippine Islands, in consideration of twenty million dollars;
and received the island of Guam in the Ladrones Islands.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s672'></a><span class='bold'>672. The Annexation of Hawaii.</span>—In the summer of 1898
it became apparent to the government that certain naval
advantages would be derived from the annexation of Hawaii.
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>
The long passage from San Francisco to the Philippine Islands
called for an intermediate station for coal and other naval
stores. Accordingly, on the recommendation of the President
and as a military measure, Congress acceded to the wishes of
the Hawaiian government, and annexed the islands by means
of a resolution, as had been done in the case of Texas.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s673'></a><span class='bold'>673. Revolt in the Philippines.</span>—Before the outbreak of the
Spanish War, the inhabitants of the Philippines, like those of
Cuba, had been in a chaotic state of discontent. Uprisings
against the Spanish government had been frequent, but these
had generally been put down with great severity. A struggle
for independence had been going on just before the Spanish-American
war broke out; but the leader, Aguinaldo, had given
up the task, in consideration of a large sum of money, and had
gone to Hong Kong. Imagining that American success would
result in the freedom of the Philippines, he returned to Manila
on the American fleet and coöperated, with his followers, in the
operations against Manila. Soon after peace was assured between
the United States and Spain, he raised the standard of
independence, in consequence of disappointment at the transfer
of the Philippines to the United States and of the terms used
by President McKinley in a proclamation issued to the inhabitants
of the islands. As might have been expected from the fact
that the opposing lines of forces were stationed close to one
another, hostilities were not long avoided. Aguinaldo’s extemporized
government and authority were in the main limited to
the island of Luzon, and his chief reliance was upon the single
tribe of the Tagals. The natives were never able to resist
successfully the advances of the American troops, but they
had possession of a large number of towns and villages, and
these had to be taken, often at the point of the bayonet. Hostilities
were protracted by the rainy season, and by the fact
that the Filipinos were divided into many inaccessible bands.
No battle of any great importance was fought; but it was not
until the spring of 1900 that the revolt dwindled into guerrilla
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span>
warfare. A year later (March, 1901), Aguinaldo was captured
through stratagems devised by General Frederick Funston.
The Filipino chieftain then issued a manifesto, urging submission
to American authority.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s674'></a><span class='bold'>674. Pacification of the Philippines.</span>—His advice was largely
followed, and the Philippine Commission, under the presidency
of Judge William H. Taft of Ohio, was soon able to report great
progress in pacification. Many hundreds of American school
teachers were sent to the islands, and American energy was at
once shown in improving sanitary conditions and in exploiting
natural resources. But spasmodic fighting has not ceased, and
it is believed by many persons that the Filipinos are far from
really pacified. This is probably more true of outlying islands
like Samar, where a small detachment of troops was almost
exterminated, than of Luzon, the center of administration.
The authorities at Washington have expressed their determination
to put an end to every form of barbarism existing
in the Philippines, and, owing to charges of cruel conduct that
have been brought against American officers and troops, have
instituted courts-martial for the purpose of trying officers and
soldiers charged with countenancing or inflicting unusual punishments,
such as the mode of torture known as the “water
cure.” It seems clear that although there has been among the
American troops some of that demoralization which always
shows itself when war is conducted in tropical countries and
against weaker races, the great mass of the American forces in
the Philippines have performed their duties satisfactorily. The
exact status of the islands with regard to the United States is
still unsettled, and it is not certain that permanent possession
of them is desired by a majority of the American people.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s675'></a><span class='bold'>675. Opposition to the War.</span>—It should not be supposed that
the course of the government in the Spanish War met with the
approval of the entire people. There were not a few who more
or less vigorously opposed the declaration of war in behalf of
the Cuban sufferers, and the number was increased when it
<span class='pageno' title='527' id='Page_527'></span>
was seen that victory involved territorial enlargement and an
increase of political responsibilities. The most active opposition
had its center in Boston. The claim was made that the
acquisition of new territory showed a tendency to imperialism
that was not justified either by the United States Constitution
or by the political principles or customs of the country. Attention
was repeatedly called to the clause in the Declaration of
Independence which declares that the basis of just government
is the “consent of the governed.” It was further asserted that
the new possessions would increase the tendencies to political
corruption, and would exert an unwholesome influence on the
government at home. In opposition to these views, the President,
and apparently a large majority of the people, held that
there was no more constitutional objection to the acquisition
of insular territory than there had been to the acquisition of
Louisiana, California, or Alaska. The advocates of the so-called
“expansion policy,” furthermore, would not admit that
added political responsibilities would increase a tendency to
corrupt government, and they claimed that, in view of international
tendencies, the country needed the newly acquired territory,
in order to protect its interests in the far East.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s676'></a><span class='bold'>676. Government of Newly Acquired Territories.</span>—On the
recommendation of the President, Congress provided territorial
governments not only for Hawaii, Guam, and Porto Rico, but also
for Alaska. These governments were framed with the intention
of developing free institutions as rapidly as the intelligence
and character of the inhabitants would admit. Cuba was temporarily
put under the control of a military government, which
was instituted in order to set the wheels of a competent local
government in motion. The President proclaimed his purpose
to turn over the government of the island to the Cubans as soon
as order and a prospect of peace had been established.</p>

<h3 id='s677a'>THE CLOSE OF McKINLEY’S FIRST ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s677'></a><span class='bold'>677. Financial Reform.</span>—The second Congress of McKinley’s
first administration early took into consideration the vexed
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span>
question of the currency, and also discussed banking laws and
refunding the national debt. The legislation finally adopted,
which went into effect March 14, 1900, placed the entire
currency of the country on a gold basis, provided for the
establishment of national banks in the smaller towns and
villages, and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue
long-time two per cent bonds, with the income of which the
shorter-time three, four, and five per cent bonds were to be
called in and paid. The success of the refunding measure was
a remarkable evidence of the firm basis on which the credit of
the country was now established. Though the new bonds sold
at par, within two months of the passage of the bill more than
two hundred and sixty millions of the old bonds had been
refunded at the lower rate. The significance of this success
is shown by the fact that, while this process of refunding
with a two per cent bond was going on, the lowest Russian
bonds were bearing four per cent; the lowest French bonds,
three and a half per cent; the lowest bonds of the German
Empire, three per cent; and the lowest bonds of Great Britain,
two and three-fourths per cent. For the first time in its history,
it might fairly be claimed that the credit of the United
States was the best in the world.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s678'></a><span class='bold'>678. Presidential Candidates in 1900.</span>—As the end of McKinley’s
term approached, it became evident that there would be
no opposition in the Republican party to his renomination.
The Convention met in Philadelphia, June 19, and adopted a
platform which indorsed McKinley’s policy of government in
Porto Rico, in Cuba, and in Hawaii, and also advocated the
retention of the Philippine Islands under conditions that would
secure for them local self-government as rapidly as the condition
and spirit of the people would permit. Interest was
chiefly centered in the nomination of a candidate for the Vice
Presidency. There were three prominent candidates, each with
strong local support, in different parts of the country. But as
soon as the delegates assembled, it became apparent that there
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span>
was a great popular sentiment in favor of the nomination of
Governor Theodore Roosevelt,<a id='r303'/><a href='#f303' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[303]</span></sup></a> of New York. He was not
only not a candidate, but with great earnestness besought the
delegations from the different states not to put forward his
name. But he had distinguished himself by his work on the
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span>
Civil Service Commission, as a police commissioner of New
York City, as a brave and picturesque commander of the Rough
Riders in the Spanish war, and as an honest and intelligent
governor of New York, and his energetic opposition to being
put forward as a candidate was of no avail. McKinley received
every vote in the convention, on the first ballot; and Roosevelt,
who sat in the convention, received every vote excepting his
own. On the 5th of July the Democratic Convention, at Kansas
City, nominated, with equal unanimity, William J. Bryan
for President, and ex-Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois,
for Vice President. The Democratic platform was vigorous in
its expressions of opposition to McKinley’s policy of expansion,
promised legislation against trusts, and declared anew its advocacy
of free coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen to one.
The impossibility of uniting all interests in these two candidates
for the Presidency was shown by the fact that ten other
candidates were, in the course of the summer, put in the field
by various small parties.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s679'></a><span class='bold'>679. Reëlection of McKinley.</span>—After an interesting but not
exciting campaign, in which the maintenance of the financial
standing of the country, rather than the approval or disapproval
of the so-called “imperial” system, became the paramount
question, McKinley and Roosevelt were elected over
Bryan and Stevenson by the large majority of two hundred
and ninety-two electoral votes to one hundred and fifty-five.
McKinley’s popular majority was even greater than that
received by him in 1896.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s680'></a><span class='bold'>680. Foreign Affairs.</span>—During the summer of 1900, public
attention was distracted from the Philippines to China, where
the Boxer uprising put foreign residents, especially missionaries,
in great jeopardy. The United States joined the chief
nations of Europe in sending forces to China. These troops
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>
behaved well; and in the subsequent diplomatic negotiations,
President McKinley and his Secretary of State, John Hay,
won much praise for their moderate and statesmanlike course
of action. The latter gained great credit also for his efforts
to secure an agreement between Great Britain and the United
States with regard to the control of any interoceanic canal
that might be undertaken in Central America. The treaty,
as modified by the Senate, was rejected by Great Britain; but
after concessions on both sides, a new Hay-Pauncefote treaty
was finally ratified (December 16, 1901), which secured to
America complete control of any such canal.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s681'></a><span class='bold'>681. Domestic Affairs.</span>—Among the most important domestic
events of the close of McKinley’s first term were the exclusion
from Congress of the polygamist Representative Roberts of
Utah; the unfortunate contest for the governorship of Kentucky,
which resulted in the assassination of the Democratic
contestant, Mr. Goebel; and the terrible storm which devastated
the city of Galveston, Texas. The completion of the
twelfth census in 1900 showed a total population of 76,303,387,
and an increase of wealth and industrial power so marvelous
as to promise almost incredible achievements in the near
future. On February 28, 1901, an act was passed reducing
the taxes that had been levied to defray the expenses of the
Spanish War.</p>

<h3 id='s682a'>McKINLEY’S SECOND ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s682'></a><span class='bold'>682. Second Inauguration of McKinley.</span>—President McKinley
entered upon his second term of office on March 4, 1901, and
retained the Cabinet as it stood at the close of his first term.
His inaugural address emphasized the material prosperity of
the country and the need of securing foreign markets by wise
treaties of reciprocity. This liberal policy was consistently advocated
by him in speeches delivered during a summer tour of
the country, and especially in one made at the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo, New York.
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s683'></a><span class='bold'>683. The Assassination of President McKinley.</span>—Immediately
after this noteworthy speech, President McKinley was taken
from the nation whose affairs he was guiding with an ever
steadier hand. On September 6, 1901, while he was holding a
reception in the Temple of Music at the Buffalo Exposition, he
was shot by an anarchist who had concealed a revolver under
a handkerchief that apparently covered a wounded hand. The
President bore himself with remarkable dignity and courage,
both at the time of the shooting and during the eight days
of suffering that followed. At first it seemed as if he would
recover; but on September 14 he died, and Vice President
Roosevelt at once took the oath of office as President. The
whole world was profoundly shocked by the tragedy, and the
manifestations of popular grief, as the body was conveyed
to Washington and from there to Canton, Ohio, were extraordinary.
On September 19, while the interment was taking
place at Canton, all labor was suspended throughout the
country. Popular indignation was naturally directed against
anarchists and political agitators of all sorts; but, in the main,
the people restrained themselves in a most praiseworthy manner.
The trial and execution of the assassin were conducted
with great promptitude and decorum.</p>

<h3 id='s684a'>ROOSEVELT’S ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s684'></a><span class='bold'>684. The New President and His Policies.</span>—Upon taking
office, President Roosevelt announced that he would continue
the policies and retain the Cabinet of his predecessor. It was
not to be expected that such a pledge would be kept to the
letter, since the new Executive differed greatly from President
McKinley in temperament and in training, and was soon confronted
with a new combination, if not precisely a new set of
problems. He was more direct and vigorous in his methods of
conducting the nation’s business, more impetuous and less politic
in his relations with men and in his appeals to the people
for support of his measures. His honest, fearless, aggressive
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span>
personality soon made him the most popular of modern Presidents
and enabled him to secure a considerable amount of good
legislation and to put his own stamp, not only upon the national
administration, but upon the general course of politics throughout
the country. He stood for an efficient civil service, clean
if somewhat partisan politics, and a resolute enforcement of
such laws as affected the methods of business employed by
monopolies and great corporations. He soon seemed to be the
representative of the interests of the many as opposed to those
of the few, and, as a result, he was praised by radicals and censured
by conservatives. In consequence, party lines began to
be broken, and it may be that Mr. Roosevelt’s greatest service
to the country will be found to lie in the personal influence he
has brought to bear upon the task of wresting his own party
from the control of capital, and of awakening the masses of the
people to the importance of preventing the chief agencies of
production and transportation from falling into the hands of
monopolists. Perhaps the criticism most often urged against
his administration is his failure to use his great power in support
of the protests made throughout the country against the
excessive protective tariff, which has fostered unfair monopolies
and a corrupt use of money in politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s685'></a><span class='bold'>685. The President’s Chief Advisers.</span>—During his term as
successor to President McKinley and throughout his term as
elected President, Mr. Roosevelt’s Cabinet underwent many
changes, most of which it is needless to specify. The secretaries
of the various departments, to whom was added in 1903 a
Secretary of Labor and Commerce, formed a competent body of
advisers and administrators, but, on the whole, only three
strongly impressed themselves upon the country. These were
John Hay, who took charge of the Department of State under
McKinley and retained it until his own death in July, 1905;
Elihu Root, who continued to act as Secretary of War until
February, 1904, and then, after a short interval, succeeded Mr.
Hay in the Department of State; and William H. Taft, who
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>
relinquished the post of first civil governor of the Philippine
Islands under American rule to become Secretary of War in
place of Mr. Root. Under both secretaries of state the consular
service was improved and the influence of America in international
affairs was greatly strengthened, especially by Mr.
Root’s visit to many
of the South American
states in 1906. Mr.
Taft brought to his post
a unique knowledge of
the problems of colonial
administration, and he
was soon recognized by
the country as a skillful
administrator and a
sound and sympathetic
adviser of the President
in all the phases of the
latter’s activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s686'></a><span class='bold'>686. The Schley Court
of Inquiry.</span>—Controversies
growing out of the
claims of Rear Admirals
Sampson and Schley,<a id='r304'/><a href='#f304' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[304]</span></sup></a>
relative to the battle of Santiago (see § <a href='#fn301'>669, note</a>), led the latter
to request a Court of Inquiry, which convened at Washington
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
in September, 1901. After lengthy proceedings, the Court,
of which Admiral Dewey was president, brought in a report
that partly vindicated and partly condemned Admiral Schley.
The latter, whose cause had won great popular favor, appealed
to President Roosevelt, but without avail.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s687'></a><span class='bold'>687. Political Events of 1902.</span>—Shortly after the accession
of the new President the attention of the country was directed
to the municipal campaign in Greater New York, which resulted
in the victory of a reform ticket supported by Republicans
and Independents over the Tammany Hall Democrats.
The reform government took office on January 1, 1902, and
gave the city, under Seth Low as Mayor, an effective and honest
administration; but, unfortunately, it did not prove popular,
and Tammany came into power again in 1904.<a id='r305'/><a href='#f305' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[305]</span></sup></a> People had
been shown, however, that municipal and State reforms could
be secured if voters would abandon party lines and act together
for the public good, and, as a result, the past few years have
witnessed much improvement in local legislation and administration
throughout the country. Meanwhile, the Fifty-seventh
Congress, which began its first session in December, 1901,
accomplished less than was to be expected in view of the large
majority possessed by the Republicans. Its comparative
inactivity was mainly due to the fact that on the evacuation of
Cuba by the American troops (May, 1902) and the setting up
of a republican government in the island, it seemed desirable for
the United States to aid the weak young country by reducing
the tariff duties on Cuban sugar and tobacco. The President’s
efforts to secure the needed legislation were blocked for a considerable
period by the opposition of the extreme advocates of
protection. It proved difficult, also, to obtain adequate legislation
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>
for the Philippines, but finally an act was passed providing
for their temporary government, and the insurrection
in the islands was proclaimed to be at an end. Another subject
which occupied Congress was the choice of a route for the
proposed interoceanic canal. The Nicaraguan route seemed
to be favored, until the Panama Company offered to sell its
property and rights for $40,000,000. This offer was finally
accepted, and the construction of the Panama Canal authorized,
provided a proper title to the route were secured (June, 1902).
The Congressional elections in the autumn of 1902 left the
Republicans still in control, but with a reduced majority.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s688'></a><span class='bold'>688. The Anthracite Coal Strike.</span>—Popular efforts to oppose,
through the action of legislatures and courts, oppressive and
illegal accumulations of capital in so-called trusts and combinations,
and struggles between organized labor and capital,
greatly occupied public attention throughout the year 1902.
The most conspicuous event in this connection was the strike of
the anthracite coal miners in Pennsylvania, which lasted from
May to October and caused considerable suffering. The miners,
who were led with much intelligence by Mr. John Mitchell,
President of the United Mine Workers of America, were willing
to submit their claims to arbitration, a fact which secured
them much popular sympathy. The mine owners, whose chief
spokesman was Mr. George F. Baer, President of the Philadelphia
and Reading Railway Company, refused to arbitrate,
and attempted to work their property with non-union miners.
Rioting followed, and the militia had to be called out; but it
was the rise in the price of fuel and the dread of a coal famine
during the approaching winter that most alarmed the public
and that finally led to a compromise. The situation seemed
so threatening that President Roosevelt, acting as chief citizen
but not as Executive, called a conference of representatives of
the owners and the miners, and urged them for the sake of the
country to arbitrate their differences. The owners at first
stood out upon their rights,—which were regarded by many
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>
persons as doubtful,—but they finally yielded, and a commission
of seven arbitrators was appointed by the President.
The commission made its report in March, 1903, decreeing
certain advances in wages, but forbidding discrimination
against non-union men.<a id='r306'/><a href='#f306' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[306]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s689'></a><span class='bold'>689. Events and Legislation of 1903.</span>—During this year a
treaty was concluded with Great Britain for the settlement of
the dispute between Canada and the United States as to the
boundary of Alaska, and a mixed commission was appointed
under it, which met in London and rendered a decision almost
entirely favorable to the United States. A reciprocity treaty
with Newfoundland was also concluded, and, in general, the high
reputation won for American diplomacy by Secretary Hay was
sustained. A reciprocity treaty with Cuba designed to benefit
the planters of the island was, however, defeated, and it was
only after an extra session of the Senate and one of the Fifty-eighth
Congress that the resistance of the protectionists was
overcome, and tardy concessions were made to Cuba.<a id='r307'/><a href='#f307' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[307]</span></sup></a> Meanwhile,
the Fifty-seventh Congress, before it closed, accomplished
more in the way of legislation than might have been expected,
in view of the bickerings to which the administration’s Cuban
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>
policy had given rise. Bills were passed, among others, which
looked to the regulation of trusts, to the creation of a general
staff for the army, to the increase of the navy, and to the
checking of undesirable immigration. Even more important
to the welfare of the country was the firm stand taken by the
President in ordering the fullest investigation of gross scandals
in the administration of the post office, and in other departments
of governmental activity. The year was marked also by numerous
important strikes,<a id='r308'/><a href='#f308' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[308]</span></sup></a> by many race riots, which were not confined
to the South, and by convictions of persons accused of
holding negroes in “peonage.”<a id='r309'/><a href='#f309' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[309]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s690'></a><span class='bold'>690. Panama and the Canal.</span>—In June, 1903, the Congress
of the republic of Colombia rejected the treaty negotiated
between the Colombian commissioner and Secretary Hay, and
proposals were made to the United States, looking to Colombian
sovereignty over the zone of the contemplated canal. These
proposals were rejected, and in their anger at the situation
thus created, the inhabitants of Panama revolted from Colombia
and set up an independent republic. This was at
once recognized by President Roosevelt, and a new treaty was
concluded with it. Though these steps were regarded by the
Colombians, and even by some Americans, as high-handed and
contrary to precedent, they were extenuated by the importance
of the political and commercial interests involved and by the
necessity of safeguarding the United States from intrigues
designed to secure a heavy payment for all concessions. Fortunately
the revolution at Panama led to no serious disturbances
either in its inception or in its consequences. The presence of
American battleships prevented Colombia from landing troops
to recover the seceded state, and the efforts made by the
Colombian special envoy to induce the government at Washington
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>
to abandon Panama to its fate were fruitless. In
February, 1904, the new treaty with Panama was ratified by
the United States Senate. Shortly afterward a decision in
a French court entirely cleared the title of the Panama Canal
Company to dispose of its property and rights to the United
States, and about the same time the commissioners for the construction
of the canal were appointed, and preliminary work was
begun.<a id='r310'/><a href='#f310' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[310]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s691'></a><span class='bold'>691. Campaign of 1904.</span>—Although the first session of the
Fifty-eighth Congress was not devoid of interest or unproductive
of important legislation, public attention was mainly centered
throughout 1904, so far as concerned politics, upon the
selection of Presidential candidates and upon the subsequent
campaign. Although President Roosevelt had alienated some
of the important Republican politicians and had caused himself
to be dreaded by many financiers, capitalists, and business
men, opposition to his nomination could not be concentrated,
and the death of Senator Hanna, of Ohio, left him without
a possible rival. His personal popularity throughout the
entire country, the general prosperity of the people, and the
inability of the Democrats to find any large, striking issue
upon which to appeal to the voters, rendered the candidacy of
the President very strong. On June 23 he was therefore
nominated unanimously by the Republican Convention, which
met at Chicago, and Senator Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana
was unanimously nominated for Vice President. The Democratic
Convention met at St. Louis, and on July 9 nominated
for President, on the first ballot, Judge Alton B. Parker of
New York. Ex-Senator Henry G. Davis, an octogenarian of
West Virginia, was nominated for Vice President. The nomination
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span>
of Judge Parker,<a id='r311'/><a href='#f311' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[311]</span></sup></a> whose only serious competitor was
Mr. William R. Hearst, the millionaire proprietor of several
newspapers, meant that Mr. Bryan and the more radical members
of the party had retired into the background in order to
give the more conservative Democrats of the East and South a
chance to show what they could do toward reorganizing the
party and leading it to victory. The latter made it clear that
they accepted the gold standard, but in the campaign that followed
they received but lukewarm support from the more radical
elements of the party, and Mr. Roosevelt was elected in November
by the largest popular majority in our history. In the
Electoral College he had three hundred and thirty-nine votes,
including those of West Virginia and Missouri, against Judge
Parker’s one hundred and forty; in other words, the Democrats
had lost every section save the South, and had not entirely
maintained themselves there. Fewer ballots, however, had
been cast than was the case in 1900, a proof of apathy on the
part of many citizens. In fact, the campaign of 1904 was a
remarkably dull one, the only excitement occurring toward the
close when charges were made regarding the raising of campaign
funds. Immediately after his election, Mr. Roosevelt
announced that he would not accept a renomination for President.
As might have been expected from the general satisfaction
of the country with Mr. Roosevelt’s administration, both
houses of Congress remained strongly Republican.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s692'></a><span class='bold'>692. Events of 1905: The Treaty of Portsmouth.</span>—Early in
the year the administration endeavored to effect a treaty with
the disorganized republic of San Domingo by which the United
States should take charge of the Dominican custom-houses and
apply a considerable portion of the revenues thereof to the payment
of the debts of the small republic. Much opposition was
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span>
manifested in the Senate, and the calling of an extra session
of that body did not secure the passage of the treaty.<a id='r312'/><a href='#f312' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[312]</span></sup></a> About
the same time there was friction with Venezuela, owing to the
sequestration of the lands of the American Asphalt Company.
In Congress, the main subject of discussion was the regulation
of railroad rates, but nothing was accomplished in the matter.
In the sphere of State legislation and administration, interest
was chiefly centered in the investigation into the affairs of some
of the larger life insurance companies and in the attacks made
upon monopolies. In the course of the inquiries conducted by
the New York investigating commission it was shown, not only
that there was gross waste in the management of the business
of the chief insurance companies, but that they spent money to
influence legislation, and made large contributions to the national
parties for campaign purposes.<a id='r313'/><a href='#f313' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[313]</span></sup></a> In the war against the
trusts, the special objects of attack were the Standard Oil Company
and the so-called Beef Trust. In municipal politics the
most interesting situation was created by the fight between
Mayor Weaver of Philadelphia and the ring of Republican politicians
in that city over what was generally regarded as a corrupt
lease of the city gas plant. The lease was defeated, and
some rather spasmodic victories were won for the cause of reform.
In New York City Mayor McClellan was reëlected by
a small plurality over W. R. Hearst, the Municipal Ownership
candidate, who claimed that extensive frauds by Tammany deprived
him of victory. On the whole, however, the most striking
event of the year was the signing of the Treaty of Peace
between Russia and Japan, which took place on September 5,
at the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. President
Roosevelt, believing that the time had come for the bloody war
between the two powers to cease, and feeling assured of the
support of other governments, sent notes to the respective
heads of the two warring powers, urging that they should open
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span>
negotiations with each other. His suggestions bore fruit at
once; the envoys were introduced to one another by the President,
whose interest in the success of the negotiations undoubtedly
contributed to the final accommodation; the treaty
was signed and ratified; and the world was at peace. No other
event connected with his administrations has reflected more
credit upon the President or has given clearer proof of the
growth of American prestige throughout the world.<a id='r314'/><a href='#f314' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[314]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s693'></a><span class='bold'>693. Legislation of 1906.</span>—The first session of the Fifty-ninth
Congress was marked by great opposition to the President and
his policies from members of his own party. This opposition
was specially bitter over the railroad rate act, which finally,
however, became a law. Questions of personal veracity were
raised, and Congress failed to pass such excellent bills as that
designed to relieve the inhabitants of the Philippines from
heavy tariff duties on articles imported into the United States.
But the President retained the confidence of the people, and
secured some important legislation—in particular, the meat
inspection law, which was passed in consequence of disclosures
made in a popular novel concerning the bad conditions prevailing
in the Chicago meat-packing establishments. A “Pure
Food Law,” looking to the protection of the consumers of
foods, drugs, and liquors, was also passed, as well as a bill providing
for the admission of Oklahoma and Indian Territory as
one state under the former name, and for the joint admission
of Arizona and New Mexico on the condition that each territory
should vote separately in favor of such joint admission.<a id='r315'/><a href='#f315' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[315]</span></sup></a>
Other meritorious legislation was also enacted—for example, a
stricter naturalization law.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s694'></a><span class='bold'>694. The San Francisco Earthquake.</span>—The most terrible
catastrophe of recent years, save the Sicilian and Calabrian
earthquake of 1908, took place on April 18, 1906, when a
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span>
destructive earthquake occurred in California, which inflicted
great damage to property and cost hundreds of lives. The
chief loss fell upon San Francisco, where the earthquake was
followed by a fire which could not be put out for several days.
About 200,000 persons were left homeless. The magnitude of
the disaster deeply impressed the rest of the country and the
world, with the result that assistance was conveyed to the
stricken region with great promptness and on a large scale.
This sympathy was succeeded by widespread admiration for
the courage and energy with which the citizens of San
Francisco at once set to work to construct upon the ruins of
the old a new city which in solidity and beauty should measurably
realize their ideals. Unfortunately, their efforts were
soon impeded by labor troubles, and the city was disgraced by
grave municipal scandals.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s695'></a><span class='bold'>695. Intervention in Cuba.</span>—In August, 1906, a revolution
broke out in Cuba against the Palma government, and in September
President Palma requested the United States to
intervene. Sincerely wishing the little republic to preserve
its autonomy, President Roosevelt hesitated to send forces, but
after an investigation conducted by Secretary Taft and acting
Secretary of State Bacon, and after the resignation of the Cuban
President and Vice President, it became clear that there was
such friction between the political factions of the island that
peace could be secured only through the exercise of force
by the United States. Late in September, Secretary Taft
issued a proclamation which placed Cuba temporarily under
American control and an adequate force was landed. The action
was favorably received by Cubans of all shades of opinion, and
the island has since remained quiet under the provisional governorship
of Charles E. Magoon. Many of the richer planters,
and not a few citizens of this country, favor the annexation of
Cuba to the United States; but the movement in this direction
can scarcely as yet be said to be strong, and it is clear that
hitherto the policy of the greater toward the weaker republic
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span>
has been generous and unselfish, save in the matter of tariff
reductions. (See §§ <a href='#s687'>687</a>, <a href='#s689'>689</a>.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s696'></a><span class='bold'>696. Race Troubles: Atlanta and Brownsville Riots.</span>—During
recent years, friction between whites and blacks seems to
have been growing more intense, not only in the South, but in
the North and West, and lynchings and riots have been disgracefully
frequent, the latest instance of lawlessness on a large
scale having occurred at Springfield, Illinois, in August, 1908.
There has also been much race friction between Americans and
Japanese on the Pacific Coast. In Georgia and in Texas, two
particularly regrettable outbursts occurred in 1906. In September,
the usual occasion of such riots, combined with the
bad effects of a violent political campaign, lashed many of the
inhabitants of Atlanta into a fury, which spent itself on the
negroes wherever they could be found, regardless of their innocence
or criminality. Several persons were killed, and the
militia had to be called out. Later, the better elements of the
city, white and black, endeavored to develop kinder feelings
between the races and greater respect for the law. The month
before there had been a shooting affray at Brownsville, Texas,
between negro soldiers stationed at the fort there and the
inhabitants of the town. In answer to protests made to him,
and on the failure of all his efforts to discover the guilty
soldiers, President Roosevelt, in November, ordered that the
entire body of negro troops involved in suspicion should be
dismissed from the service in disgrace. This action was both
applauded and condemned. It led to inconclusive investigations
and to much discontent among the negroes and their
friends.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s697'></a><span class='bold'>697. Elections of 1906.</span>—The election in November resulted
in a victory for the Republicans, but their majority in Congress
was materially reduced. Several State elections attracted attention,
but public interest was mainly centered upon the contest
for the governorship of New York between the Republican
candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, who had won a national
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span>
reputation by his skillful conduct of the investigation of the
great insurance companies (see § <a href='#s692'>692</a>), and the Democratic
candidate, Mr. W. R. Hearst, who had been a competitor of
Judge Parker’s for the Presidential nomination (see § <a href='#s691'>691</a>),
and had so nearly defeated Mr. McClellan for the mayoralty
of New York City (see § <a href='#s692'>692</a>). Mr. Hearst was also the
candidate of the Independence League, which was generally
understood to be a party mainly controlled by him. His securing
the Democratic nomination alienated many Democrats,
and led to his defeat, but that the election was a personal
triumph for Mr. Hughes was shown by the election of the
Democratic State ticket to all the offices except the governorship.
Mr. Hearst subsequently withdrew from the Democratic party
and carried the Independence League into national politics.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s698'></a><span class='bold'>698. The Panic of 1907.</span>—Although numerous matters, foreign
and domestic,<a id='r316'/><a href='#f316' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[316]</span></sup></a> made the twelvemonth that followed the elections
of 1906 interesting to the contemporary observer of public
affairs, it seems clear that to the future student one event
of the year will overshadow all others—the financial crisis of
the autumn. It began in October with the failure of a New
York trust company, and for some weeks the stringency of the
money market was acute, particularly in the business centers
of the East. Many private fortunes, especially of those engaged
in any form of speculation, were impaired, and industry
was greatly checked, with the result that thousands of men
were thrown out of employment and that immigration from
Europe showed a decided falling off. In some quarters there
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span>
was a disposition to attribute the panic to the President’s policy
of subjecting the methods of the railroads and trusts to strict
examination, and of insisting that they should comply in every
respect with the statutes which had been enacted to control their
activities; but more impartial students regarded the catastrophe
as the natural consequence of the strain to which capital had
been subjected for some years during a period of speculation
and industrial inflation. Credit had been strained in America
and abroad, and defects in the system of currency had created
among business men a feeling of insecurity and uncertainty
which was probably more accentuated by the talk than by the
actions of the Executive. His speeches, perhaps, had something
to do with occasioning the crisis, but it was an inevitable event
and, on the whole, a salutary one. It taught the public that no
country, however rich and energetic, can defy with impunity
the principles of honest and conservative financiering, that all
sections and nations are so closely bound that one cannot suffer
without affecting the rest, and that the part an administration
can take, whether in precipitating or in alleviating such a crisis,
is unimportant in comparison with the actions of financiers,
investors, and business men in the aggregate.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s699'></a><span class='bold'>699. Events and Legislation of 1908.</span>—One of the most
spectacular events of the year was the cruise of the Atlantic
fleet in the Pacific Ocean. The voyage was made <span class='it'>via</span> Cape
Horn, and the fleet was received with great enthusiasm, not
only by the people of the Pacific Coast, but also in New Zealand,
Australia, and Japan. As a display of naval power and
efficiency, the cruise was a success, and its political effects seem
to have justified its inception, especially as the welcome given
our sailors in Japan did much to show that there was no immediate
cause for friction with that country. Less spectacular,
but not less important, was the ratification of numerous arbitration
treaties, including one with Japan, and of eleven
Hague conventions relating to the conduct of war. A conference
of the governors of the States met at Washington in May,
<span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span>
on the call of President Roosevelt, and discussed the best
methods of conserving the natural resources, the forests and
waterways of the country. It was generally regarded as a
forward step, and it led to the appointment of a national
commission charged with this important matter. There was a
remarkable wave of activity among the advocates of legislation
against the sale of intoxicating liquors, leading, especially in
the South, to the adoption of prohibition and local option laws.
The first session of the Sixtieth Congress passed laws in the interest
of government employees injured in the performance of
duty, and similar measures, and, finally, after much debate and
filibustering, a compromise Currency Bill, known as the Vreeland-Aldrich
Bill. One of the provisions of this was the establishment
of a commission of senators and representatives
to consider the monetary system and the banking laws of the
country. The Ways and Means Committee of the House was
authorized to hold recess sittings and to hear testimony with
regard to the need of revising the tariff. Late in the year,
Mr. Andrew Carnegie, the famous millionaire steel manufacturer,
created a sensation by declaring before the committee
his belief that the industry in which he was an expert needed
no protection whatsoever.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s700'></a><span class='bold'>700. The Election of 1908.</span>—The Republican Convention
met in Chicago in June, and on the first ballot nominated for
President, Secretary William H. Taft,<a id='r317'/><a href='#f317' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[317]</span></sup></a> of Ohio, for whose candidacy
the administration had exerted all its influence. Representative
James S. Sherman, of New York, was nominated
for Vice President. The Convention in its plank with regard

to the issuing of writs of injunction<a id='r318'/><a href='#f318' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[318]</span></sup></a> by the Federal Courts
in cases involving labor disputes failed to satisfy some of the
labor leaders, who subsequently supported the Democratic
party. The convention of the latter party met in Denver in
July and nominated Mr. W. J. Bryan on the first ballot.
John W. Kern of
Indiana was nominated
for Vice
President. The
Democratic platform
was more
specific than the
Republican on tariff
reduction, railway
regulation, and anti-monopoly
legislation;
but it did not
secure enthusiastic
support, especially
from convinced
tariff reformers,
and its proposal of
the creation of a
fund for securing
depositors in insolvent
national banks
was not regarded
with favor in conservative circles. The minor parties also made
nominations, and expected to play a larger part in the election
than they succeeded in doing. On the whole, the campaign
was spiritless, despite the regrettable sensation caused by the
production of letters associating the names of several public
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span>
men with the Standard Oil Company. It was soon apparent that
Mr. Taft would receive the solid support of the Eastern States,
and that, while Mr. Bryan would probably reduce the Republican
vote in the West, he would not be strong enough to carry
many States. In the election on November 3, 1908, Mr. Taft
secured three hundred and twenty-one electoral votes, including
those of Missouri and West Virginia; Mr. Bryan one hundred
and sixty-two, including those of Nebraska, Colorado, and
Nevada, and six of the eight votes of Maryland. Judge Taft
defeated Mr. Bryan by about 1,250,000 votes, but the Democratic
candidate himself surpassed by even more than this the
vote received by Judge Parker in 1904. The chief parties
made gains, and that there was considerable independent
voting was proved by the election of Democratic governors
in Ohio, Minnesota, and Indiana. The Republicans were still
left with a comfortable majority in Congress.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s701'></a><span class='bold'>701. The Country at the Close of 1908.</span>—Some revival of
business has been noted since the election, and the country has
settled down to await quietly the beginning of the new administration,
with little expectation that Congress, which has shown
itself to be greatly exasperated with the President, will accomplish
much besides routine business. An <span class='it'>entente</span> arranged by
our Department of State with the Japanese authorities has
dissipated much of the popular alarm with respect to the sinister
intentions of Japan toward American interests in the Pacific.
Many fourth-class postmasters in the North and West
have been brought by President Roosevelt under civil service
rules—an action which cannot fail to lessen the power of the
political bosses. The government has maintained a very calm
attitude toward Holland and Venezuela, the relations of which
have been strained, and measures have been taken to secure
the quiet and prompt withdrawal of American troops from
Cuba. The chances of a real revision of the tariff seem to
have increased. An important decision against prominent
labor leaders, who had flouted an injunction of a court, has
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span>
rendered it likely that the law with regard to boycotts will
be more clearly enunciated and understood in the future, and
that the respective rights of capital, labor, and the general
public will be more thoroughly safeguarded. Perhaps no better
illustration of the strength and essential soundness of the
country can be pointed to than the generosity and promptitude
with which America has responded to the appeals in behalf of
the sufferers in the Calabrian earthquake of December, 1908.</p>

of July 3, Sampson started for a consultation with Shafter, who was some miles
east of the mouth of the bay. Before going he had left specific directions
as to methods of action in case of Cervera’s appearance. Sampson was some
miles away when the approach of the Spanish fleet was detected. Though he
returned at once, he reached his fleet only at the close of the engagement, in

Another event of great popular interest marked the year 1902. This was
the friendly visit of Prince Henry of Prussia, which took place in February
and March. The Prince came to America ostensibly to witness the launching
of a new yacht built for his brother, the Emperor of Germany; but, in reality,
his mission was one of courtesy and amity to the Republic. He was received
with an enthusiasm not equaled, perhaps, since the visit of Kossuth in
1852. He was entertained in New York and Washington, and was especially
welcomed by the large German population of St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee.
He won great favor everywhere by his simple dignity, and did
much by his visit to further the cause of peace and international good will.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s702'></a><span class='bold'>702. The Industrial Period.</span>—While it is always difficult
for people to understand thoroughly the characteristics of their
own age, it seems almost certain that the epoch of American
history which begins with the readmission of the Southern
states to the Union in 1870, and ends with the Spanish and
Philippine wars in 1898–1901, will be known by some
such name as the “Industrial Age.” As we have just seen,
many interesting events occurred and many prominent men
figured in it; but these are overshadowed by the enormous
development of manufactures, trade, commerce, and farming,—that
is to say, by the stupendous results that have followed
the application of the nation’s mind and energy to almost
every department of human industry.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s703'></a><span class='bold'>703. Growth of Population.</span>—The census of 1870 was inaccurate
with regard to the population of the South. The
corrected figures give a total of nearly forty million inhabitants
(39,800,000) to the entire country. During the decade 1860–1870,
no less than seven new territories were organized, showing
a great gain of population in the far West. There was also a
very considerable development of urban populations, New York
City standing just below the million mark, Philadelphia nearing
seven hundred thousand, and Chicago and St. Louis struggling
for commercial supremacy in the West, the former city approaching
three hundred thousand inhabitants. Ten years later,
the population of the Union was 50,155,178. Colorado was the
<span class='pageno' title='552' id='Page_552'></span>
only new state admitted during the decade, but Florida, Texas,
and the far West were being rapidly settled. The growth of
the cities was not relatively very great, but New York showed,
in 1880, upward of one million two hundred thousand inhabitants.
By 1890 the population of the country had reached
62,622,250, six new states, all Western,—Idaho, Montana,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming,—having
been admitted. The organization of Oklahoma as a
territory and the admission of Utah as a state (1896) made
the Union proper in 1900 consist of forty-five states, four
territories, and one District,—the total population in 1900
being slightly over seventy-six millions. In 1890 New York
state and city still led in population, as also by the census of
1900; but Pennsylvania and Illinois proved formidable rivals.
The annexation of various suburbs made Greater New York
(3,437,202 in 1900) next to London the largest city on the
globe. Other cities throughout the Union, especially in the
north and central West have also, as a rule, grown remarkably.
In 1900 there were seventy cities each containing a population
of over fifty-three thousand.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s704'></a><span class='bold'>704. Immigration.</span>—The tendency of foreigners to seek our
shores, which was very marked during the period 1830–1860,
has increased, rather than diminished, since that time. Even
in the distracted decade of the Civil War, over two million
three hundred thousand immigrants were received; the next
decade saw two million eight hundred thousand; while that
ending in 1890 saw nearly five million two hundred and fifty
thousand. A falling off took place in the ten years ending in
1900, owing to special legislation against pauper immigrants
and to other causes; but the total for the decade was still
enormous,—3,687,564. The character of the immigrants has
somewhat changed,—a fact which is due to the increased
influx from Austria, Hungary, Russia and Poland, and Italy,
the last-named country leading all others during the decade.
Many of the foreigners that have settled among us have made
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span>
excellent citizens, who have contributed to the national wealth
and industry in a way that can hardly be praised too highly.
These immigrants have been mainly attracted to the northern
half of the country. Many of them have settled in New England,
in the great cities, especially New York and Chicago, and
in the Northwest. In the South, with the exception of Texas,
they form but a very slight part of the population, for the
presence of the negroes as competitive laborers has kept them
out of what would otherwise be an attractive region.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s705'></a><span class='bold'>705. The Negroes.</span>—On the whole, the negroes of the South
have progressed since they were freed from slavery. Many of
them are taking advantage of the school facilities afforded
them, and some remarkable men, like Booker T. Washington,
principal of the Tuskegee (Alabama) Institute, prove that the
race is capable of great development, especially under the
guidance of its own leaders. They appear to be successful
as small farmers, and it seems likely that they will do well in
certain industrial occupations. Meanwhile, they are being
rapidly disfranchised, and it is hoped that the friction between
them and the whites is subsiding. This friction is still kept
up, however, by crimes and consequent lynchings which shock
the better elements of the population everywhere.</p>

<h3 id='s706a'>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s706'></a><span class='bold'>706. Industrial Greatness.</span>—The industrial greatness of the
United States cannot easily be described. A few statistics
may be cited, however, to give a faint idea of what wonderful
progress has been made. In the year ending June, 1901, we
exported merchandise valued at the enormous sum of nearly
$1,500,000,000—the largest figures in our history. After deducting
imports and allowing for the export and import of
gold and silver, the trade balance for the year was $670,000,000.
Other statistics relating to banking, insurance, agriculture,
shipbuilding, etc., help us to realize the power of the
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span>
nation. The number of ships of all sorts built in 1901 was
fifteen hundred and eighty, nearly double the number built in
1897. The tonnage increase of 1901 over 1900 was nearly
ninety thousand. It is estimated that in 1901 there were
forty-four shipyards, of $68,000,000 capital, employing forty-six
thousand men. Railroad statistics are much more striking,
while those compiled in connection with the great Steel Trust,
and those covering the money spent upon our public schools
and universities, would alone suffice to prove that we stand
practically foremost in wealth and energy among the nations
of the world. The total revenue of the general government
for the year ending June 30, 1901, was $587,685,338; the
total expenditures were $509,967,353. In 1900 no less than
2,105,103,000 bushels of corn and 552,230,000 bushels of wheat
were gathered by American farmers. These stupendous figures
strain even the most capable imagination. The late eminent
statistician, M. G. Mulhall, wrote not long since that he knew
nothing to compare with the United States “as regards the
physical, mechanical, and intellectual force of nations.” This
force is not equally distributed throughout the country, the
census of 1900 showing that the Northwest is in many respects
the predominant section of the Union. But the Middle states
and New England still retain their lead in matters of culture,
and are very progressive, while the Pacific states have
developed wonderfully, as also the South, whose future is full
of promise.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s707'></a><span class='bold'>707. Social Characteristics.</span>—As a matter of course, this
great growth of wealth has affected in a marked way the character
of the people of the United States. Never before has
the American been so enterprising and so anxious to prosper
in life. His interest in his private affairs is so great that he
often neglects to work for good government, and so allows corrupt
men to make fortunes out of the public treasury. A rich
leisure class has been developed, whose manners and morals
are not those of the well-to-do Americans of a hundred, or
<span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span>
even fifty, years ago. Extremes of wealth and poverty are
found confronting one another in the great cities, and the
wealthy corporations are often accused of controlling legislation
in their own interests. Nevertheless, it seems clear that
the masses of the people live wholesome lives, and that the
public conscience of America will not tolerate abuses when once
these are made plain. The churches are very active, and no
other people have ever had better school and library facilities
or made fuller use of them. No other nation has ever shown
such interest in organized charities or in reforms of various
sorts, such as those directed against the evils of easy divorce
and of intemperance. In morals, as well as in wealth and
industry, the century just closed marks a great advance for
America.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s708'></a><span class='bold'>708. Education and Literature.</span>—In general culture, also, a
distinct advance has been made. There has been an educational
renaissance. The great modern university has grown
up out of the old-fashioned college; yet the college, whether in
town or country, still continues to do a useful work. Public
schools have increased in greater proportion than population,
and are equipped and conducted on improved plans. There are
also new agencies for reaching people who cannot go to school
or college. Chautauqua and its kindred summer schools, university
extension courses, lecture lyceums, and literary clubs
are doing very valuable educational work. Many of the
leading newspapers devote a portion of their increased space
to the same purpose. The popular magazines have steadily
improved and have been important agencies in making the
American people the best educated and most wideawake in
the world. There has also been a great increase in the number
of books produced and in the cheapness with which
classic literature can be secured. In recent years, no American
author seems to have equaled in influence or general
merit such great writers as Cooper, Hawthorne, Emerson,
Poe, and Longfellow; but the average of literary talent has
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span>
risen, and the mass of good poetry, fiction, and especially
history and biography, has grown remarkably. Good historical
romances have been widely sold; short stories have been
made a distinct branch of art; the life of every section and
almost every state has been described in one or more good
novels. In criticism and scholarship, also, improvement has
been shown. Finally, in such authors as “Mark Twain”
(Samuel L. Clemens, born in 1835), William Dean Howells
(born in 1837), Sidney Lanier (1842–1881), and Charles Dudley
Warner (1829–1900), the great writers of the last generation
have had worthy successors.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='s709'></a><span class='bold'>709. Inventions and Science.</span>—An industrial period naturally
puts a premium upon everything that ministers to its necessities.
The last thirty years have seen many parts of the country knit
by a wonderful system of electric street railways and of telephones.
Various forms of electric lighting have also been
introduced, and it seems impossible to set any limit to the discoveries
of science in connection with this mysterious force.
Capital has been accumulated by great corporations, known as
“trusts,” which occupy gigantic buildings and use larger and
more costly machinery than was ever before known. Even private
life is affected in manifold ways by recent inventions. Not
merely has the cost of manufactured articles been decreased
and their numbers vastly increased, but correspondence, modes
of locomotion, and other activities have been markedly affected.
The typewriter is supplanting the pen, and the bicycle and
automobile have made a triumphal entry into the remotest
neighborhoods. Better still, there has been an enormous advance
in medical science, particularly in surgery; while in
engineering and photography, Americans have been notably
successful. They have also fairly held their own in pure
science, in astronomy and physics, in meteorology and geology.
On the other hand, they have cultivated the beautiful as well
as the useful arts, and have produced architects and painters
and sculptors of whom the civilized world has taken much
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span>
notice. If, therefore, industrial achievement and territorial
expansion seemed to be the most salient features of American
history at the close of the nineteenth century, it may nevertheless
be believed that an epoch of great literary and artistic
achievements awaits the country in the century that has just
begun.<a id='r319'/><a href='#f319' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[319]</span></sup></a></p>

This chapter was written on the basis of the census of 1900, and it has
seemed best to leave it intact for the present. The census of 1910 will doubtless
furnish even more extraordinary evidence of the country’s growth in
population and wealth, but the essential characteristics of the epoch can
scarcely be held to have been materially modified. It may be noted that the
admission of Oklahoma brought the number of the states up to forty-six.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>declaration of independence.</span></span></h2>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;font-size:.8em;'><span class='sc'>In Congress, July 4, 1776.</span></p>

<h3>A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED<br/> STATES OF AMERICA, IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span>, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hold these truths to be self-evident:—That all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever
any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right
of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government,
laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw
off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.
Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be
submitted to a candid world.
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for
the public good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be
obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts
of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation
in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and formidable
to tyrants only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,
and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole
purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with
manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others
to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation,
have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the State remaining,
in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasions from without,
and convulsions within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that
purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; refusing
to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions
of new appropriations of lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent
to laws for establishing judiciary powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their
offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of
officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the
consent of our Legislatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to,
the civil power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to
their acts of pretended legislation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders
which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
<span class='pageno' title='561' id='Page_561'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province,
establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries,
so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing
the same absolute rule into these colonies;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and
altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments;</p>

<p class='pindent'>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection,
and waging war against us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and
destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with
circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas,
to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their
friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has excited domestic insurrection among us, and has endeavored to
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages,
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages,
sexes, and conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in
the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor have we been wanting in our attentions to our British brethren.
We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature
to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them
of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have
appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured
them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations,
which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation,
and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war,
in peace friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,
in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span>
world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the
authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare,
That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and
independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British
crown, and that all political connection between them and the state
of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free
and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace,
contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things
which independent states may of right do. And, for the support of this
declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence,
we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
honor.</p>

<h3><span class='sc'>Preamble.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>We</span>, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution
for the United States of America.</p>

<h3><span class='sc'>Article I. Legislative Department.</span></h3>

<h4><span class='it'>Section I. Congress in General.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of
the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section II. House of Representatives.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen
every second year by the people of the several States; and the electors in
each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most
numerous branch of the State Legislature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to
the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United
States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in
which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole
number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of
years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.
The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first
meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent
term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. The number
of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but
each State shall have at least one representative; and until such enumeration
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span>
shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose
three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one,
Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight,
Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South
Carolina five, and Georgia three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. When vacancies happen in the representations from any State, the
executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such
vacancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other
officers, and shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section III. Senate.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators
from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six years, and each
Senator shall have one vote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the
first election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three
classes. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the
expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the
fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so
that one-third may be chosen every second year; and if vacancies happen,
by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature of
any State, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until
the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age
of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and
who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he
shall be chosen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the
Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. The Senate shall choose their officers, and also a president <span class='it'>pro tempore</span>,
in the absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall exercise the
office of President of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When
the President of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside;
and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of
the members present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. Judgment in case of impeachment shall not extend farther than to
removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of
honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment,
and punishment according to law.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section IV. Both Houses.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and
representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof;
but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations,
except as to the place of choosing senators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such
meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by
law appoint a different day.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section V. The Houses Separately.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications
of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum
to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and
may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such
manner and under such penalties as each house may provide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its
members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds,
expel a member.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to
time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment
require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either house,
on any question, shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be
entered on the journal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Neither house during the session of Congress shall, without the consent
of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place
than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section VI. Disabilities of Members.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for
their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of
the United States. They shall in all cases, except treason, felony, breach
of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the
session of their respective houses, and in going to or returning from the
same; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be
questioned in any other place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was
elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United
States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span>
have been increased, during such time; and no person holding any office
under the United States shall be a member of either house during his
continuance in office.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section VII. Mode of Passing Laws.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;
but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments, as
on other bills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and
the Senate shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of
the United States; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not, he shall
return it, with his objections, to that house in which it shall have originated,
who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed
to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of that house
shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections,
to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved
by two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all such
cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and
the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered
on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned
by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have
been presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had
signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in
which case it shall not be a law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question
of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United
States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him,
or, being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the
Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations
prescribed in the case of a bill.</p>

<h3><span class='sc'>Article II. Executive Department.</span></h3>

<h4><span class='it'>Section I. President and Vice-President.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years,
and, together with the Vice-President, chosen for the same term, be
elected as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof
may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators
and representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress;
but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or
profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. [The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot
for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of
the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the
persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they
shall sign and certify, and transmit, sealed, to the seat of the government
of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President
of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of
Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be
counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the
President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors
appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and
have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives
shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no
person have a majority, then, from the five highest on the list, the said
House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the
President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from
each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of
a member or members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of
all the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the
choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes
of the electors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should remain
two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by
ballot the Vice-President.]<a id='r320'/><a href='#f320' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[320]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and
the day on which they will give their votes, which day shall be the same
throughout the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United
States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to

the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office
who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen
years a resident within the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death,
resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said
office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President; and the Congress
may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability,
both of the President and Vice-President, declaring what officer
shall then act as President; and such officer shall act accordingly, until
the disability be removed or a President shall be elected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation,
which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the
period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive
within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>8. Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the following
oath or affirmation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The President shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy
of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when called
into the actual service of the United States; he may require the opinion
in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments
upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices; and
he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against
the United States, except in cases of impeachment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present
concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,
judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United
States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and
which shall be established by law; but the Congress may by law vest the
appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President
alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may
happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions, which
shall expire at the end of their next session.

with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall
make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall
have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the
trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have
directed.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>Section III. Treason.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according

such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one
years of age in such State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or elector
of President and Vice-President, or holding any office, civil or military,

judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United

or given aid and comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by
a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by
law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for
services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.
But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE Ancient World is intended for young students in high
schools and academies and will be found well within the
scope of their abilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general, the author has aimed to emphasize the unity in
historical development; to show that national life, like individual
life, has continuous growth and development, and that a
knowledge of the past explains the present. Every experiment
in government in ancient times has its lesson; and in the hands
of Professor West history becomes an instrument for teaching
the duties of modern citizenship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most stress is laid on those periods of history which were most
important to the development of civilization. In following this
plan two general features are noteworthy:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Wars receive little attention. Space is given rather to
the causes and conditions preceding a war and the results that
follow it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Little weight is given to the legendary periods of Greek
and Roman history, and the space thus gained is devoted to the
wide-reaching Hellenic world after Alexander, and to the Roman
Empire which had so deep an influence on later history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every paragraph the leading idea is brought out by italics,
and illuminating quotations introduce each chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book teaches the use of a library by giving specific references
to topics for reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table of contents covers thirty-four pages and gives a
minute analysis of the book down to the subject of each paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are forty-one maps and plans, which are made the basis
of study, suggested by questions given in the text. There are
also ninety-nine illustrations taken from authentic sources.</p>

<div class='blockquoter8'>

<p class='noindent'>By Professor <span class='sc'>Willis M. West</span>. With thirty-nine Maps and numerous
Illustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;12mo, half leather, 673 pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Price, $1.50.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HIS volume, beginning where the author’s Ancient World
ends, shows the development of the various forces which
the ancient world had brought together and which had been partially
welded in the empire of Charlemagne. In time it covers
eleven centuries; but as much space is given to the last hundred
years as to the preceding thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with the outbreak of the momentous French Revolution,
the book is remarkably full; for the author believes it
wise to treat with comparative briefness the ephemeral phases
of the Middle Ages in order to gain adequate space for a full
treatment of the marvellous nineteenth century, and so for an
intelligent introduction to the twentieth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the book is noteworthy in the large share of attention
given to the most recent history. To stop the history of Europe
at 1871 is to leave the pupil in the rear of the world of to-day
much farther than is ordinarily represented by a human lifetime.
Since that date a new Germany, a new Italy, a new and stable
French Republic have been created, through the principles of
democracy and nationality. The growth of these principles, their
struggle with the divine right monarchies, and final victory, are
described in vivid language. To put the student in touch with
the recent movements in politics and in society is the business of
the high school course in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present revision has been brought down to September,
1907.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book contains thirty-nine maps, mostly colored, and seventy-eight
illustrations. There are copious references for further
reading, topics for special reports, and review exercises. The
footnotes supply a running comment on the text—short quotations
from eminent authorities or interesting facts called up by
the narrative. There is also a useful classified bibliography.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>N important feature of this history is the definite method of
presentation. At the beginning of each period the author
briefly outlines the character and the tendencies of the time.
He then elaborates this outline, and before leaving the subject
summarizes it in a few brief sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book teaches that the achievements of the English people
have been solid and enduring, not dramatic and sensational, and
concern the more peaceful aspects of human existence—government,
legislation, agriculture, industry, commerce, and finance—quite
as much as the stirring scenes of land battles and sea
fights. To quote the author: “History to-day has got rid of
much of the stage thunder that passed current in the older narratives.
It points to the industry that underlies wealth, and to
the wealth that makes military success possible. It lays stress
upon the national or social conditions that render the great statute
or legislative act necessary, and upon the pressure of food or
population and the spurring of religious conviction that urge men
to brave the sea and undertake colonization. It calls attention
to the deep significance of peasants’ rebellions, religious revivals,
and industrial revolutions in preparing the way for the rise of
democracy and the transformation of the social life of a nation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book contains seventeen maps; a large number of genealogical
tables; seventy-four well-executed illustrations taken from
authentic sources; a facsimile of a section of the Magna Carta;
and reproductions of drawings on early manuscripts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A carefully selected list of books that will be useful in any
school library, a detailed chronological table, and bibliographies
covering the best and most recent works, add to the usefulness of
the history.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
